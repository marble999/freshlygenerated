*It's been a month since Chipotle announced it would phase out all artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors from its menu and in what could be its most surprising move, it will now be also switching to farm-to-table antibiotic-free meats.*

*I got some tips from Pro Chef Eric Jacobson, who shared the recipe below to show how Chipotle can serve Cilantro-Lime Butter and Chipotle Rub on its steak.*

*It's a great appetizer, but my favorite thing about it is the meatballs. Don't be afraid to add peppers and onions to them, because they're a pleasant contrast to the rich Cilantro-Lime Butter. Trust me, even when I got a rib chop like this last Sunday night, I would eat half again.*

*Giant Chipotle-Rubbed Steaks With Cilantro-Lime Butter*

*Serves 2*
### Ingredients

* 1 lb/454g steak

* 2/3 cup Chipotle Shrimp Mushroom Burrito Sauce

* 1-1/2 tablespoons Chipotle Citron Sauce

* 1 tablespoon Cilantro-Lime Butter

* 2 tablespoons diced jalapeÃ±o

* 2 tablespoons Chipotle aioli

salt and pepper to taste

aioli, for garnish
### Directions

1. Grate all of the steak in a food processor with a round metal grater. Add the Sauce and Citron Sauce, then Taste for salt and pepper and add more Chipotle sauce if you need it. Spoon into a mini-Oven and preheat over 400F. Once the bread is slightly browned, use a spatula to gently "close" the grill and rest the steak for about 15 minutes or until it is very tender. To serve, shred the steak and place in a single layer on a warmed platter. Scoop up a little of the Cilantro-Lime Butter and dip the steak in it and garnish with the aioli.
