*Instagram YET another version of wine syrups and there are a lot of different flavors. But don't let the name fool you. It's a syrupy treat, just like the wine itself.*

*It's also fantastic for desserts, being the simplest and sweetest drink to make. For those who need a bit more flavor, just add more red or white wine. This is a fantastic drink to accompany cocktails and desserts, especially lighter eaters such as myself.*

*The most basic recipe is easy to make. You'll need some white wine, candied ginger, brown sugar, vinegar, and water. If you're looking for a dessert syrup to go over freshly baked cookies, ask your store's bakery department. For something more decadent, use a bottle of bourbon or chardonnay, and serve it over fruit salad or as a dessert mixer.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1/2 cup white wine

* 1 cup sugar

* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon

* 1/2 tsp. allspice

* 1/2 tsp. ground ginger

* 1/2 tsp. salt

* 4 cups water

* 1 lb. candied ginger
### Directions:

1. 1. Combine the wine, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and salt in a saucepan and heat over medium heat. Continue to cook until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid is thickened.

1. 2. Add the water, and stir until completely incorporated. Once the syrup is thickened, pour it over the candied ginger. Serve right away.
