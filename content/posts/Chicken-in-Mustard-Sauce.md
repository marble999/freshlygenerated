*My husband and I love sharing our favorite recipes, and this is one of ours. We share it with our family whenever we can, or whenever our dog gets mad because I make him French fries, which he loves. It's simple, yet decadent in taste.*

*Serves 6.*
### Ingredients

* 2 large Yukon Gold potatoes, boiled for 10 minutes

* 1 tsp. whole-grain mustard

* 4 tablespoons butter

* 1 chicken breast, chopped into 1-inch pieces

* 1 large onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces

* 1 cup chicken broth

* 2 tbsp. marjoram

* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt

* 1/4 tsp. pepper
### Directions

1. In a medium saucepan, toss the potatoes with the mustard. Add enough water to cover them by 1/2 inch. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and chicken and sautÃ© until the onions are soft, about 15 minutes.

1. Add the marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Serve over the potato sauce.
