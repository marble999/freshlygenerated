*Serves 6*
### Ingredients

For the eggplant chutney:

* 4 pounds eggplant, peeled and sliced into wedges

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 1 white onion, thinly sliced

* 2 garlic cloves, minced

* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano

* 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt

Freshly ground black pepper

* 1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves

* 1/2 cup dark raisins

* 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese

For the grilled skirt steak:

* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced shallot

* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Freshly ground black pepper

* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

* 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat
### Directions

1. For the eggplant chutney: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place eggplant on a baking sheet. Drizzle eggplant with olive oil and sprinkle with the onion, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper. Roast until the eggplant is tender when pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Stir together remaining ingredients and add to eggplant. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

1. For the grill: Place a charcoal grill or grill pan over medium heat and douse with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Grill steak until thoroughly charred on the outside, about 4 minutes, and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes longer. Lower heat to medium-low and continue to grill for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Set aside. Keep warm. Place 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon mustard in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper and whisk well. Set aside.

1. For the grilled skirt steak: Place oil in a small bowl and add onion and garlic. SautÃ© over low heat until onion is lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in vinegar and mustard and season with salt and pepper. Add steak and toss. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Heat grill or charcoal fire until hot and place grill pan over medium heat. Grill until the steak is rare to medium-rare, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over and grill about 4 minutes more. Keep warm.

1. Cook's notes: The eggplant chutney can be made up to 2 days ahead. Store covered in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
