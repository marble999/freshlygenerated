### Ingredients

* 5 sweet potatoes

Â½ cup heavy cream

* 3 garlic cloves, chopped

* 2 carrots, grated

* 1 serrano chili, roasted, torn into small pieces

* 1 small cauliflower head, chopped

* 1 teaspoon sea salt

* 1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper

* 1 tablespoon olive oil

* 1 tablespoon butter

* 1 tablespoon horseradish, chopped
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange sweet potatoes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and sea salt. Roast for 40 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, take the olive oil and butter from the refrigerator and place them in a small skillet over medium heat. Once the butter just begins to brown, add the green onion and sautÃ© until a golden color. Remove and pour the pan into a bowl and then return the lid to the skillet to prevent burning.

1. While the onions are stirring, cut the garlic in half lengthwise, then cut out the bulb and use a small julienne to make a little skin. Then peel and cut into quarter-inch slices and place in a blender along with the carrots, roasted chili, and roasted cauliflower. Blend for about 1 minute. Then add the creamed vegetables, along with the parsley, sriracha, salt, and pepper, and blend until smooth. Stir in the butter.

1. Pour into a shallow bowl and sprinkle with the remaining parsley.
