*Your pull pork is supposed to be juicy and tender, with a tenderized, yet intact center.*

*If, like me, you find the fat coating the outside of the pork to be so dry it’s almost a barrier, those super-salted/marinade/cut pieces of pork always come in handy. But what if the meat inside is actually juicy and a perfect mahogany? That recipe will be for you.*

*Pulled Pork*
### Ingredients

* 16 2/3-inch (6-by-4-inch) bones, such as those of pork loin

Salt, for dredging pork cubes

* 6 pork loin strips

* 2 cloves garlic, minced

* 2 tablespoons black pepper

* 1 small chili, seeded and minced

* 2 tablespoons paprika

* 1 tablespoon cumin seeds

* 2 tablespoons dried oregano

* 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

* 6 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

* 1/2 cup Dijon mustard

* 8 slices baguette, crusts removed and cut into 1-inch squares
### Directions

1. Cook the bones and pork in a pot of salted water to a simmer. Remove the bones and remove the pork from the pot. Allow the pork to cool slightly. Drain the pork well and pat it dry with paper towels. Stuff the meat into freezer-safe bags and chill to firm up. Drain the beef, barley and mirliton and pat them dry.

1. In a small saucepan, combine the garlic, black pepper, chili, paprika, cumin, oregano, cayenne, thyme, vinegar and mustard. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.

1. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the pork from the freezer and pat it dry with paper towels. Transfer the meat to the skillet and cook, turning as needed, until browned on all sides, about five minutes. Carefully transfer the pork to a cutting board and let it sit for five minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.

1. Cut each pork strip into four pieces. Transfer one piece of pork to a clean plate, lay two pieces on the plate and spoon one teaspoon of the sauce over each piece. Repeat with the remaining meat and sauce. Serve with baguette squares.

1. Correction: Originally, The Washington Post reported that the pork and veal were marinated with red wine vinegar, which is incorrect. While the mustard will work well as a sauce, red wine vinegar is not included in the ingredients.
