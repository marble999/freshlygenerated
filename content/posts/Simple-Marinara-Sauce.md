*According to the restaurant Raymond Vineyard, the secret to their marinara sauce is that they use equal parts of tomato paste and canned white tomatoes, and they cook it down in that same can so it simmers and thickens. It’s a simple technique that requires very little equipment, such as a long, hot, clean pan or a deep skillet — and, eventually, any sauce will lend itself to this combination.*

*The sauce will fall apart if it’s poured directly from the can, so I like to to put my hand on the can to press out the canola oil and oil that’s soaks up in the mixture.*

*If you haven’t become spoiled by the huge spread of marinara sauce you can buy in Italian grocery stores, I recommend that you enjoy these small, simple servings with a salad and a side of, say, Italian olives, or another baked vegetable (like zucchini) to add color and season. I usually even serve the sauce over hot spaghetti and simply pour the sauce on top. I often make the sauce one day ahead, then refrigerate it and refrigerate it until needed the next day.*

*serves 4 as a side dish*
### Ingredients

* 1-1/2 cups canned white tomatoes

* 1-1/2 cups low-sodium tomato juice (branch-can version works fine)

* 2-1/2 cups whole milk

* 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed

* 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

For garnish

* 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese

Olive oil
### Directions

1. Pour half of the canola oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the canola oil and the garlic and sauté, stirring constantly, until soft, about two minutes. Add the onion and cook until softened, about three minutes.

1. Add the tomatoes, tomato juice, canola oil, vanilla, flaxseed, red pepper, salt and pepper, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens to a syrup consistency, approximately six minutes.

1. Transfer the sauce to a blender and blend on high until smooth, adding another tablespoon of oil to thin the sauce if needed. Keep the sauce at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to mellow.

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

1. Add the sauce to the baking sheet and bake until the sauce is golden brown and bubbling, approximately 15 minutes. Serve hot with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of cheese.
