*For Southern chicken, I found this recipe at Cafe Adelaide in Laurel, Maryland, a college town in Maryland’s Western suburbs. This is less spicy than most but it has less spice than many pan-fried chicken recipes do as well. Also, the chicken is rather moist, which makes it the ideal chicken to eat with a spoon.*
### Ingredients

• 1 cup all-purpose flour

• 1 teaspoon baking powder

• 1/4 teaspoon salt

• 1/4 teaspoon pepper

• 1 chicken breast, boneless and skinless

• 1/2 cup chicken broth

• 2 to 3 tablespoons water

• 1/4 cup vegetable oil

• 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
### Directions

1. Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Dip chicken breast in flour and coat in baking powder mixture, shaking off excess flour and shaking chicken breast back and forth gently. Place in a single layer in a preheated 400-degree oven for 10 minutes or until all flour is absorbed. Remove from oven and turn chicken breast over so it is skin side up and cook 15 to 18 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Meanwhile, combine broth and water and cook over medium heat until reduced by half. Place frying pan over medium heat and slowly drizzle in vegetable oil, swirling pan around to make sure oil is evenly distributed. Once oil is hot, add chicken. Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle chicken with salt and red pepper and stir into dressing. Serves 4.
