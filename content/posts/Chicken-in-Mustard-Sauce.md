*My husband and I love sharing our favorite recipes, and this is one of ours. We share it with our family whenever we can, or whenever our dog gets mad because I make him French fries, which he loves. It’s simple, yet decadent in taste.*

*Serves 6.*
### Ingredients

* 2 large Yukon Gold potatoes, boiled for 10 minutes

* 1 tsp. whole-grain mustard

* 4 tablespoons butter

* 1 chicken breast, chopped into 1-inch pieces

* 1 large onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces

* 1 cup chicken broth

* 2 tbsp. marjoram

* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt

* 1/4 tsp. pepper
### Directions

1. In a medium saucepan, toss the potatoes with the mustard. Add enough water to cover them by 1/2 inch. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and chicken and sauté until the onions are soft, about 15 minutes.

1. Add the marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Serve over the potato sauce.
