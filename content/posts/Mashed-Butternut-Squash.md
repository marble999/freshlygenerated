*That's right. Today's soup has a really sweet flavor! It's best as an accompaniment to roasted veggies or salads. I love this soup so much that I make it for myself.*

*The best part of cooking butternut squash this way is that it's way more versatile. It can be used in a double scooped dish, like Creamy Butternut Squash Soup, for that sweet mix of sweetness and spice, which I use throughout my dishes.*

*You'll also need to refrigerate and bring the soup for the dish with some time to thaw the squash. Don't throw it out! Let it sit for at least two hours or overnight to keep the butter from absorbing and breaking the tender, delicious squash apart.*

*Storeable Substitute:*

*Creamy Butternut Squash Soup with butter*

* 1 small butternut squash, peeled and diced

Â¼ cup finely diced onion

Â¼ teaspoon ground allspice
