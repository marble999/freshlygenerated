*Watch Melissa Clark's report on how to get your entire family involved with eating green.*

*We all know broccoli is a great veggie to have on hand at all times, but, like, why not bake some broccoli as well? It goes together quite well with Parmesan cheese, just add some tangy lemon juice, if you want that low-acid kick, and good ol' bread crumbs. No one ever asks "How did you know to bake vegetables?" and broccoli is without a doubt one of the better-known cruciferous vegetables -- considering all the chefs and nutritionists who have preached their virtues -- so they should.*
### Ingredients

* 2 cups broccoli florets

* 1/4 cup olive oil

* 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

* 1/2 cup bread crumbs

* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

* 1 teaspoon sea salt
### Directions

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees.

1. Combine broccoli florets, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl, toss to coat.

1. Form mixture into five-inch balls. Arrange balls onto a baking sheet and bake 10 to 12 minutes until lightly browned.

1. Enjoy!
