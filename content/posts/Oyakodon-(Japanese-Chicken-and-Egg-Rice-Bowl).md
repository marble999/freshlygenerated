*The fact that young women like American women are embracing the humble dish of ramen is testament to the fact that once-a-day Asian food isn't just a teeny-tiny niche. From meaty, slippery pot stickers to Sichuan-influenced egg rolls, this salty, sour, bright, brown and yellow classic has traveled from the rural countryside to the heart of every major metropolis in Japan. This simple dish makes a great mid-week lunch to kick-start the weekend. Serve over steamed rice and a scoop of nori for texture. It's a cheap, wholesome way to sit down and have a healthy food rush, thanks to the chicken and egg.*
### Ingredients

* 3 cups cooked white or brown rice

* 2 large eggs

* 1 tablespoon butter

* 1 tablespoon soy sauce

* 1 tablespoon vinegar

* 2 teaspoons cornstarch

* 2 teaspoons oil (olive or sunflower)

Kosher salt and black pepper

* 1 pound chicken breast cut into bite-size pieces

* 1 cup spinach or green sprouts

* 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed and diced

* 1 yellow bell pepper, seeds removed and diced

* 1 head iceberg lettuce, cut into bite-size pieces

* 1 cup orange or red string beans, cut into bite-size pieces
### Directions

1. In a large saucepan, boil 1 cup of water and add 1 tablespoon of salt. When the water is boiling, add the rice. Bring the water to a boil again, add the eggs and cook in the boiling water until done, about 5 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water and drain; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, soy sauce, cornstarch and a dash of salt. Add the egg mixture to the rice. Stir in the chicken, spinach, bell peppers, lettuce and string beans. Cook in the oil mixture for about 4 minutes on medium heat, tossing occasionally. Serve right away.
