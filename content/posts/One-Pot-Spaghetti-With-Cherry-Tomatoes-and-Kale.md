*This recipe is a favorite in my house. Fresh, flavorful and easy. I make it often and it is easy to reheat, too. Best of all is the homemade pasta sauce, which works for both meatballs and spaghetti.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 lb (500g) spaghetti (or vermouth); or 2/3 lb (700g) fettuccine (or tagliatelle); or one pound (500g) linguine (or penne)

Salt and pepper

* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

* 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped

* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

* 6 cups (1L) cherry tomatoes, halved

Kosher salt

Â½ cup (125mL) cornstarch

Â½ cup (125mL) tomato sauce

* 2 cups (500mL) beef broth

Â½ cup (125mL) tomato paste

* 3 cups (750mL) arugula

* 1 cup (250mL) chopped fresh kale
### Directions:

1. 1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C).

1. 2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the spaghetti or pasta according to the package directions. Drain. In a medium pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the red pepper flakes and the tomatoes, reduce the heat to low and cook for 8 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened and the liquid is reduced by half. Season with salt.

1. 3. Whisk together the cornstarch and tomato sauce in a small bowl. Cook the beef broth in a large saucepan, stirring frequently, until it just begins to boil. Add the tomato paste, reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce and meat broth and cook for 10 minutes, stirring once. Whisk in the tomato sauce and tomato paste mixture and cook until the sauce is smooth and thick. Stir in the pasta sauce and chicken broth.

1. 4. Pour the sauce over the pasta and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and top with arugula and kale. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over the arugula.
