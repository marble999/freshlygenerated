*A Southwestern coleslaw is a hot topic with your salad friends -- hence the long buzz surrounding Panza salad. What everyone really wants is a version that is both spicy and creamy -- one without borscht-like creamy bits (chunks of cabbage). If you're one of the impatient types, try this (quick, easy and inspired) version from young, warm New York chef Laura Werlin, which combines mandarin oranges, mango and kaffir lime leaves.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 head iceberg lettuce

* 4 mandarin oranges, thinly sliced

* 1 large fresh mango, thinly sliced

Kaffir lime leaves (for spicing)

* 1/2 poblano pepper, finely diced

* 3/4 cup diced potatoes

* 1/2 cup diced yellow onions

* 1 1/2 cups shredded brisket (or leftover roast beef)

* 1/2 tsp granulated garlic

* 1/4 tsp cumin

* 1/4 tsp brown sugar

* 1/4 tsp salt

About 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Garnish: micro greens, freshly grated daikon (red radish)
### Directions:

1. Rinse iceberg lettuce. Using a mandoline or vegetable peeler, cut the lettuce in half lengthwise. Scoop out the deep blue fibers, and discard the white portion. Place cut sides of lettuce on a cutting board and shred with a shredder or large melon baller into thin strips. Repeat with other half of lettuce.

1. Prepare the mandarin orange slices by slicing off the orange rind; refrigerate.

1. In a medium bowl, combine mandarin oranges, mango, lime leaves, poblano pepper, potatoes, yellow onions, brisket, garlic, cumin, brown sugar, salt, and olive oil. Fold in shredded lettuce and dressing. Taste for seasoning.

1. Use a slotted spoon to transfer coleslaw to a serving bowl. Drizzle with about 1/4 cup dressing. (If you don't have extra-virgin olive oil, use reserved dressing.) Garnish with micro greens, daikon, and micro cilantro (or orange or lime zest) and serve.
