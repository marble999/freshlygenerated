*Recipes are all well and good, but what about the joys of serving your guests? You can make everything fancy and perfect, or you can give your guests the opportunity to be outrageous. Who doesn’t love to watch their guests dance for hours on end? I put a light spin on the latke recipe of most of my parties and left out the crunch of walnuts. Instead I had a fun fun way to bring a pocket of walnuts to my guests. I also wanted to add a splash of marmalade to the dish, but I couldn’t quite come up with the right combination. So for this recipe I kept it simple and chose a fruity marmalade for the top of the pancake. I also paired the sweet filling with a sprinkling of mini meatballs from the mason jar. They look perfect on top of the pancakes and after you have them all to yourself, you’ll be ready to start another party!*

*Be sure to keep the sides of the pancake filled with more marmalade to get that same lovely shade. You can also lighten the recipe up by making each pancake larger than usual and filling them with more sour cream or even avocado slices.*

*Serves 8*
### Ingredients

* 1 cup sour cream

¼ cup yellow corn syrup

* 2 eggs

* 1 large egg yolk

* 1 cup minced onions

* 2 tablespoons water

* 1 tablespoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

* 2 teaspoons dried red pepper flakes

* 1 cup mini meatballs

¼ cup shredded cheddar cheese
### Directions

1. Whisk together the sour cream, corn syrup, eggs, egg yolk, and 2 cups of the chopped onions. Add the salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, mix well. (I cut up the meatballs and added them to the egg mixture. I also put the mixture in a serving glass and topped the pancake with a teaspoon of marmalade and cheese.) Cover and chill for 1 hour. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut 8 banana shallots and lay them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cook the shallots until soft, then use a fork to trim the ends. Add the shallots to the mixture. Mix in the meatballs. Pour the mixture into a ramekin or soufflé dish, placing a layer at the top with the ramekin. Repeat until all 8 ramekins are filled. Bake the ramekins for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool.
