*It’s become quite common to use a processor to make traditional noodle dishes but can often get repetitive. This tried-and-true ryuban is easy to make and can be sliced and cooked without the shredding of any meat.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1-1/2 pounds (1 pound of wheat noodles)

* 1 small onion, peeled and chopped

* 1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces

* 1/2 pound (4 ounces) salmon fillet, or leftover salmon cuts or fish sticks, cut into small pieces

* 2 cloves garlic, chopped

* 1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger

* 3 tablespoons sesame oil

* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds

* 1 cup (100 grams) low-sodium soy sauce

* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

* 1 tablespoon low-sodium peanut oil

* 1/2 teaspoon fish sauce

* 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)

* 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
### Directions:

1. 1. Boil your cooked noodles, drain off the water and drop into a medium saucepan. Stir to evenly coat. Set aside.

1. 2. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the onion, carrot, and salmon and ginger, and other veggies, in a small saucepan for 3 to 5 minutes or until the vegetables start to soften. Set aside.

1. 3. Heat 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil in a medium saucepan with a medium heatproof handle over medium heat, and sweat the garlic until the garlic begins to become translucent. Add the ginger, sesame oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, fish sauce, and peanuts. Cook until the sauce begins to bubble and turn a deep yellow. Set aside.

1. 4. Add a large clove of the garlic into the cooking oil in the saucepan and stir until it heats up. Heat the rice in the same pan for a couple of minutes and keep the heat low.

1. 5. Stir in the sauce made from the sesame mixture, heating gently. Add the tofu into the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tofu becomes opaque and the sauce thickens a bit.

1. 6. Drain the noodles, transfer to plates, and top with the sauce from the saucepan. Serve immediately.
