*Even the easiest of suppers takes time to come together. At the risk of sounding like a baker, I have a secret weapon to help you out: chili and toast.*

*I loved the traditional mesquite-grilled romaine steak with slaw, and if that's not on your heart, it may be time to move down south to Texas. I know because my step-mom lives in Houston, and she tells me about how the temperature can get uncomfortably high, especially in the summer. What she doesn't talk about is how pretty the toast is. Not only does it look appealing, but it melts right into your mouth and brings out the flavors of the toasted bread.*

*But this recipe requires a little more planning, as it requires you to make a tortilla. As the tomatillos, tomatoes, and onions cook down into chili, the topping that holds the tortilla together will be ready in just about a minute. This is the perfect recipe to give to guests who are overly excited about the food they're bringing.*

*Chili Lobster With Texas Toast*

*Yield: 2 servings*

*Make Ahead: You can prepare the toasted bread before serving, but don't expect it to be perfect until an hour or so after the chili is.*

*Serves: 6*
### Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

* 1 garlic clove, minced

* 1 tablespoon tomato paste

* 1 can, 20 ounces, whole-kernel corn

* 1 can, 28 ounces, whole-kernel corn, drained

* 1 teaspoon chili powder

* 1 teaspoon ground cumin

* 1 cup chopped bell pepper

* 3 cups shredded corn-on-the-cob

* 3 teaspoons salt

* 3 tablespoons chili powder

* 3 tablespoons ground cumin

* 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

* 1 cup diced tomatoes

* 6 Texas-style whole-grain or semi-sweet or other whole-grain breads (I like to make it tomato-yellow), halved lengthwise or if you're using whole loaves, or a new sourdough, toasted

* 2 or 3 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, seeded, chopped

* 3 roasted tomatillos, peeled, seeded, diced

Chopped fresh cilantro leaves or dill sprigs

* 1-1/2 cups diced mild or hot cooked lobster meat, cooked according to package directions (the cooking time will depend on the size of the lobster)

* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
### Directions

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, garlic, tomato paste, corn, corn, chili powder, cumin, pepper, corn-on-the-cob, salt, chili powder, and cumin or cayenne to the skillet, stirring often. Cook, stirring until the corn is well coated, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, bell pepper, and coconut milk. Stir, and cook over medium-high heat until the tomatoes have released their juices, about 6 minutes. Add the lobster and onion. Cook, stirring, until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes.

1. Pour the beef broth or water back into the pan and deglaze. Return the liquid to the pan and stir. Add the goat cheese and remaining ingredients and blend.

1. Remove the skillet from the heat. Place the skillet on a baking sheet and pour the skillet of garlic butter over the top to cover the vegetables. Microwave on High until the mixture starts to smoke, about 1 minute. Serve with toasted brioche or sourdough.

1. Chef Philip Krim says cooking traditional Mexican dishes is "forever intimidating" because of the amount of research involved in the preparation and slow cooking of the dishes. But he says that "the more you understand, the more you'll be able to create and do." Krim, who has worked at many of Mexico's top restaurants, from Equinox in Manhattan to the Plateau de Beleza in Acapulco, has created a range of recipes that celebrate Mexican flavors while addressing misconceptions that are often directed at the cuisine.
