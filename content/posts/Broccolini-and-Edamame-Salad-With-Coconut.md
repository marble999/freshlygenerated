*Downtown farmers' markets are being featured, the creative minds behind consulting firms like Remedy Creative are writing up recipes and food editors are tackling high-quality, yet affordable ingredients for the new cookbook Rebel Chefs. It's a great time to find something delicious, filling, and light to make weeknight meals that aren't complicated, time-consuming, or too expensive. Enter broccolini and edamame. This salad is the perfect way to include these beautiful vegetables with the springy finish that's so hard to get. It's too easy to make a second version that makes the salad even more nourishing.*
### Ingredients

* 1 head broccoli, cut into florets and cooked in boiling water until softened (do not overcook, or the broccoli will become mushy)

* 3 cups fresh edamame (use a bag for steaming)

* 1 cup chicken broth

* 1/4 cup mango chutney

* 1/4 cup light mayonnaise

* 2 to 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

* 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

To finish

Chili flakes or drizzle of toasted sesame oil (optional)

Salt and pepper
### Directions

1. Prepare your broccolini. Spread in a single layer in a single layer in a shallow baking dish. Lightly brush with olive oil, arrange broccoli florets over each other, and drizzle with a little cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 2 hours.

1. Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil. Steam the edamame, lift out with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Heat the broth in a small saucepan over medium heat.

1. Meanwhile, whisk together the mayonnaise, chutney, vinegar, and ground cumin in a small bowl. Pour a little of the chilled broth over the mayonnaise mixture, stirring until blended. Ladle over the broccolini and edamame, then toss with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

1. Author's Note:

1. The food of the Southwest is a vital part of this recipe. The cloves of the Spice Shop in Santa Fe let us into their family recipe for fajitas, which I shared with readers a few months ago. This version of broccolini and edamame uses a little honey to complement the freshness of the herbs and the tang of the mayonnaise. If you like a bit more heat, I add chili flakes (also available at the Spice Shop).
