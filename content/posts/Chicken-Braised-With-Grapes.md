*What a delicious food to serve to a date. The flavors of chicken and grapes take a new turn as you combine them for this delicious entree. To keep it yummy and quick to prepare, you can serve them separate for the main course or together for the side.*

*The fruit is paired with the heat of the curry, which spices this dish up with just the right amount of depth, all while remaining somehow light. Season with soy sauce and salt and pepper, and serve with rice.*

*Chicken Braised With Grapes*

*Serves 2*
### Ingredients

* 1-1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes

* 1 cup half-and-half

* 1 tablespoon rice wine or red wine vinegar

* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce

* 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric

* 1 tablespoon cumin

* 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder

* 1 tablespoon curry powder

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

* 3 tablespoons mirin

* 3 tablespoons sherry wine vinegar

* 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger

* 3/4 teaspoon sugar

* 2 tablespoons hot sauce

* 1 cup red grapes, pitted and cut into quarters

* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, add the chicken and bread crumbs, half-and-half, vinegar, oyster sauce, ginger, garlic powder, turmeric, cumin, mustard powder, curry powder, salt and pepper. Stir to combine thoroughly. Spread the marinade over the chicken and distribute evenly, cover with foil and place in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and return the chicken to the oven for 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice the chicken lengthwise, set aside. Meanwhile, pour 1/2 cup of mirin and 2 tablespoons of sherry wine vinegar into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 8 minutes, until slightly thickened. Stir in the chopped ginger and sugar and continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Pour the grape sauce over the chicken, cover with foil and place in the oven for 10 minutes. Slice the chicken in half and place cut-side down in a 10x15-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons of mirin and sherry vinegar. Roast for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and beginning to brown. Let sit for 10 minutes before slicing.
