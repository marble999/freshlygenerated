*Crab Meat is a delicacy that would make a superb match with the hearty linguine here. It's also a dish whose splendor only could shine through when finished with fresh basil. If you have fresh basil, use it here. Go out and buy extra. And please consider purchasing a crab knife or two if one isn't already part of your arsenal. You can also skip the anchovies to keep things simple. To make this recipe less cloying, we've added basil pesto to the linguine before tossing it with crab meat. We also cut the crab meat into small pieces and placed it in a large bowl to be mixed with the noodles as they cook.*

*Crab Meat With Linguine*

*Serves 4*
### Ingredients

* 1 cup dry white wine

* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

* 1 1/2 cups crab meat (diced)

Fresh basil (optional)

Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

* 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic

* 2 small sprigs fresh thyme

* 12 ounces linguine
### Directions

1. In a medium saucepan over high heat, heat the wine and flour until it starts to smoke, about 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring often, until the sauce thickens slightly and the consistency of a thick cream, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the crab meat and basil, cook until the crab is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. When the liquid comes to a boil, add the garlic and thyme sprigs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic has softened, about 2 minutes. When the sauce has reduced slightly, add the linguine and reduce the heat to low. To serve, drizzle the sauce over the linguine.
