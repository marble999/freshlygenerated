*When I was a little girl, my parents would make me an egg white omelet every Sunday afternoon, just to serve up as a simple breakfast. This traditional recipe is never sent off to school with me but, I trust my mom to serve a simple dish with only the most simple flavors — nothing fancy. It tastes amazingly good. And because I love cooked eggs — but mostly cooked scrambled eggs — this recipe is on my to-make list. The eggs are fried to the crescendo of their deliciousness then a side of crispy, vegan-made French fries is added for a fun snack during lunchtime. There’s no garnish for the dish or recipe, so you can bring it any time — but I know it sounds cheesy to suggest this for a weekday meal, but this isn’t so easy to keep quiet in public.*

*Chinese Stir-Fried Tomatoes and Eggs*

*Serves 4-6*
### Ingredients

:

* 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided

* 2 cloves garlic, minced

* 1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and finely chopped

* 2 1/2 pounds large firm tomatoes, washed and seeded, with juices reserved

* 1 pound thin fresh garden potatoes, washed and scrubbed

* 1 teaspoon ground ginger

* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric

* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

* 3/4 teaspoon white pepper

* 2 tablespoons soy sauce

* 3 tablespoons sesame oil

* 2 tablespoons water

* 4 ounces cooked turnips, peeled and coarsely chopped

* 4 ounces cooked white asparagus, unpeeled and coarsely chopped

* 1 small green onion, thinly sliced on the diagonal

* 4 large eggs

* 3 sheets French-style whole wheat or gluten-free potato chips

* 3 tablespoons minced cilantro

* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, for garnish
### Directions:

1. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, just long enough to coat the bottom of the pan with oil. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the shiitake mushrooms and cook 3 minutes or until they begin to brown. Add the tomatoes and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes start to caramelize and the potatoes are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger, turmeric, cumin, white pepper, soy sauce, and water to the mix and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan to keep the mixture warm, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to desired consistency. Divide the vegetables into four plates and top each with one egg. Ladle two ladles of the sauce over each egg and garnish with asparagus, a few turnips, a green onion, and a few crunchy fries. Serve immediately.

1. Note: For this recipe, you could follow my original recipe and fry the asparagus as you did the potatoes or you could add a few dashes of pepper to the sauce and stir in the asparagus.

1. Variations:

1. Add 6 cups of water and roughly chopped shallots to the simmering liquid. Cover and cook until the water starts to boil and reduces by half. Then, add the asparagus (and any liquid that evaporates from it). When the potatoes are cooked, remove the vegetables from the sauce, let them cool a bit, and then cut into a quarter-inch cubes. Then, add the vegetables and add the chicken stock (or water) to the pan. Cover and cook just until the vegetables are tender and cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes. If you want a more classic French-style baked potato, use slices instead of whole potatoes, and skip the green onions or broccoli. Just as it always does, you are better off cooking the tofu for that recipe — I found a tofu smoothie was way better. I didn’t try to change the dipping sauce recipe, but I am really into a soy sauce and sake sauce.
