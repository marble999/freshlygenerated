*The bread I use for this recipe is the bread stuffing in sourdough, which is chewy and nutty-tasting without too much flour. If it isn't available at Whole Foods, search for bread stuffing in the store bakery section.*

*MAKE AHEAD: The batter must be made at least 2 hours ahead, then it can be stored in the refrigerator.*
### Ingredients

* 1 cup flour, plus more as needed

* 1 cup cold water

* 1/4 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 teaspoon sugar

* 2 tablespoons low-fat sour cream

* 8 (6-ounce) large eggs

* 1 tablespoon best-quality, sweetened condensed milk
### Directions

1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Mix the flour, water, salt, sugar, sour cream and eggs in a large bowl. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat for 3 to 4 minutes, until a dough forms.

1. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm.

1. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it just begins to bubble. Remove from the heat. Pour half of the milk into a small bowl and set aside.

1. Return the saucepan to medium heat, add the rest of the milk and begin to whisk until thickened. Add the condensed milk to the hot milk and whisk until thickened. Pour the mixture into the bowl of dough, stirring gently with a rubber spatula to avoid lumps.

1. Lightly oil a large bowl. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the batter into the bowl and use a slotted spoon to transfer to a cooling rack. Let rest for 5 minutes. Flip the batter and spoon the rest of the batter into the bowl. Roll the patties in the remaining batter until just covered with a sheet of plastic wrap.

1. Put the breadtables in the baking dish and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are crispy and light golden. Serve hot with the whipped sweetened milk sauce.
