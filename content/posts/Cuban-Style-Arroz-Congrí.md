*Arroz is such a Spanish staple, and here I've tweaked the recipe to make it a little bit lighter. These were a very popular dish in Cuba, thanks to the revolutionary spirit of independence with its traditional ingredients and recipes.*

*Serves 4*
### Ingredients

For the rice

* 3 cups cooking water

* 1Â½ cups long-grain basmati rice

Â¼ teaspoon salt

For the sauce

* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter

Â¼ cup brown sugar

Â½ cup brown sugar

Â¼ cup flour

* 3 eggs

Â¼ cup milk

A few drops of honey

* 1 garlic clove, chopped

Freshly ground black pepper

For the arroz

* 1 tablespoon olive oil

* 1 large yellow onion, minced

* 2 tablespoons white vinegar

* 1 tablespoon lime juice

* 1 Â½ cups chicken stock

Â½ teaspoon salt
### Directions

1. To prepare the rice, soak the rice in the water for about 30 minutes. Make sure you leave the lid on, or the rice will stick to the bottom of the pot. Drain the rice. Using a strainer, skim the bran and pearl rice from the top of the rice. Trim the tops off the arroz, so it will spill a little. Put the rice on a big sautÃ© pan. Add the vegetable oil and onions. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the vinegar, pepper, and lime juice. Simmer until the arroz thickens, about 15 minutes. Add the stock, salt, and garlic. Bring to a boil, then simmer for another 1 to 2 minutes. Once the sauce thickens, reduce the heat to a simmer. Carefully stir in the eggs. Serve warm.
