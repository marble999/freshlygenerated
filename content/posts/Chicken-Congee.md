*This is a fantastic recipe to serve at the annual Chinese Food Festival in Columbus, Ohio. Fruity flavors and comforting rice take the place of its hearty meat components.*
### Ingredients

* 2 cups chicken broth

* 2 teaspoons sesame oil

* 3 cups long-grain white rice

Â½ cup hoisin sauce

Â¼ cup hoisin-soy sauce mix

* 1 cup oyster sauce

* 1 teaspoon white pepper

Â½ teaspoon ginger juice
### Directions

1. In a medium saucepan, bring broth to a boil. Add chicken, and cover. Simmer over medium heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until chicken is completely cooked and no longer pink. Then remove chicken from pot, reserving the broth; keep chicken broth. Put rice in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add sesame oil, and stir often until rice is heated through. Add rice, hoisin sauce mix, hoisin sauce mix, oyster sauce, and white pepper. Stir constantly, covering tightly after each addition. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Be careful not to let sauce burn. Stir in ginger juice and reserved chicken broth. Pour over rice. Taste for seasoning. Serve, plain or with garnishes such as grated ginger, scallions, and shredded carrots.
