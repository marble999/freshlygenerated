*Cut up some mushrooms, toss them with a little olive oil, seasoning them with salt and pepper, and roast in a 300 degree oven until just tender. When they are slightly browned on top, sprinkle with nuts or seeds, if desired, and serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.*

*Bruschetta With Mushroom Bruschetta*
### Ingredients

* 2 cups salted olive oil

* 1 onion, diced small

* 1 clove garlic, minced

* 1 can cream cheese

* 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes

* 3 1/2 cups whole-wheat breadcrumbs

* 1 1/2 cups mini or baby fingerlings, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch slices

salt and pepper

* 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

* 1 can (19 oz) whole almonds
### Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the cream cheese and cook, stirring often, until just creamy. Add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the liquid has reduced by about half.

1. Add the breadcrumbs, fingerlings, salt and pepper, and make sure the slices of bread do not touch, to taste. Toast in a 400 degree oven until lightly golden and lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Using a large, sharp knife, carefully transfer to a cutting board and let cool to room temperature. Spread a generous amount of the mushroom Bruschetta mixture over the toast. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, almonds, and serve.

1. Makes: 8 servings
