*The beauty of citrus flavors on a roast is that they lend their subtleties to a limited repertoire of roasts. Kale, spinach and turnips are good for flavor (and the salad that goes with them). But chicken--and red meat more generally--lacks the nips and curries that can instantly reinvigorate red meat dishes.*

*On a spring chicken, citrus is perfect: It's as easy to work with as it is to use. With six citrus at our fingertips, citrus is a season-spanner, bringing just the right essential charm without dominating the plate. With its bright citrus funk and bright, lively citrus sweetness, citrus gremolata is the perfect accompaniment to roast chicken legs.*

*Roast Chicken Legs with Cilantro Gremolata*

*When you're invited to serve roasted chicken legs for dinner, give everyone a serving from the same pot. Keep it simple: Served as a side dish, cilantro and garlic make a highly dramatic combination that pairs well with the chicken.*

*Serves 6*
### Ingredients

* 5 red or yellow bell peppers, cut into julienne strips

* 2 navel oranges, cut into julienne strips

* 4 oranges, cut into julienne strips

* 1 lemon, zested and juiced

* 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh cilantro

* 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

* 8 chicken legs

* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Gremolata (recipe follows)
### Directions

1. Heat a large sautÃ© pan over medium-high heat. Add the peppers, oranges, lemon, cilantro, parsley, salt and pepper and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the pepper is very soft and almost transparent.

1. Split the thighs of the chicken with a spoon and dip each in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the fat renders out. Turn the chicken over and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook for 1 minute and repeat with the second rack of chicken. Transfer the chicken to a baking dish or serving platter. Spoon the salsa over the chicken. Serve with the gremolata.
