*Laurent, the Michelin-starred chef behind Restaurant Laurent et Ida, offers his interpretation of smoked salmon roasts, with no preparation prescribed. Whichever technique you choose, try to keep the fruits to 20 minutes.*

*Salmon roasts without butter are fairly common. The flavor of the butter is overpowering. You can add a little water if the salmon is not cooking long enough, and I would also suggest lightly salt the olive oil before placing it in the grill pan. For this method, the freshest salmon, salted, can be a bit of a liability. If you can't find any fresh salmon around that's smaller than 2 pounds, a farmed farmed salmon will work equally well.*

*For this dish, you'll want to avoid using peels -- a decision that is not without risk. We've included two grapefruits (shaved, but if they're not covered in sugar, the blanched color may look more attractive) for contrast.*

*Make sure to buy salmon with the thickest possible pink meat, the fishmonger will usually give you a helping hand here. We made a conscious effort to not include a processed product when making this dish, but that doesn't mean there won't be one when you are ready to eat. Feel free to use the cooking water as a pitcher of wine if you like.*

### Ingredients

* 10 slices dry-cured salmon

Crushed salted peppercorns

* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar

Olive oil

* 12 to 16 grapefruits
### Directions

1. Place salmon and pimenton in a covered saucepan. Add the peppercorns, vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Simmer the butter mixture for 3 minutes over medium heat. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 20 minutes. Remove the butter. Squeeze the grapefruit to remove the pectin and set aside. Arrange salmon, followed by grapefruit, onto a platter and top with melted butter. Drizzle the grapefruit with the extra-virgin olive oil and serve.
