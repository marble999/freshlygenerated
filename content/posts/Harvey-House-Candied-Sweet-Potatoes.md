*I love it, I love it, I love it. Candied sweet potatoes are a staple of my sweet potato recipes. And I love them paired with bourbon, but this one is perfect by itself.*

*Yield: 4 large sweet potatoes*

*Cooking time: about 1 hour 10 minutes*
### Ingredients

* 3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled

¼ cup sugar

¼ cup bourbon

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. Peel your sweet potatoes. Carefully cut into quarters. Poke the peel into the flesh of your sweet potatoes so that it can be easily removed, keeping the skin around if you want to roast the potatoes the same way you would a steak.

1. Place your sweet potatoes cut side down on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until the sweet potatoes are soft and the top is nicely caramelized, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Turn the sweet potatoes over, sprinkle with bourbon, and bake for another 20 minutes. You’ll be able to fully remove the skins when you’re done. The caramelized sugars will turn the sweet potatoes brown and cheeseish.
