*Soft-shell crab Poor-Boy*

*Nutrients*

*The mini crabs are marine-meat-grade products and are certainly fairly rich compared to your average crab or crab cake. The shells also help the meat maintain its purity and taste, which is nice when eating this dish.*

*Foie-No-Do*

*There’s a bigger crab on the other side of the boat, so instead of taking two bites of what you’ve grabbed, swipe your finger up and down the crabmeat like you would a candy bar.*

*Mole Verde*

*Peruse the salad’s dressing menu, which has everything from a wine-by-the-bottle to a Champagne-spiked olive oil. Some of the concoctions, such as the one pictured, contain shrimp. Here’s where to eat them.*

*Champagne Spiked Olive Oil*

*About ¼ cup*
### Ingredients

* 1 ounce Champagne or white wine

½ cup extra virgin olive oil

* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

Salt and pepper
### Directions

1. Combine Champagne or white wine, olive oil, and mint. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a small amount of the mixture over your salad. If you’re using shrimp, place one in a small dish. Drizzle a small amount of the dressing over shrimp, then place the dish in the oven to toast until the shrimp is tender, about 4-5 minutes. Repeat with another teaspoon of dressing on the shrimp. Serve the shrimp with your salad.

1. Directions

1. Combine sherry, vinegar, water, garlic, cilantro, green onion, and cucumber in a shallow dish. Stir until completely mixed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Garnish the salad with the lemon.
