*After a few days of eating healthy foods, you probably feel like you should add a little bit of sweetness to your diet too. Enter the custard-flavored clafoutis and their wondrous purple hue. It's all about a wonderfully rich custard, lightening the load of ingredients needed to dole out a sort of luxe dessert.*

*This savory version of clafoutis combines a purÃ©ed sauce with Swiss chard, corn, and black truffle for such an intriguing meal. A minor quibble is that the chard stalks end up being chopped off in the process -- but even if they did get left out, it still would be a treat. After all, this kind of bite-size cornmeal pudding can just pack a powerful flavor punch.*
