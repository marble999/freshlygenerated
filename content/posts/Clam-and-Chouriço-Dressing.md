*Blogger Melissa Clark, founder of Lemonade Kitchen, shares a seasonal mustard dressing that’s sure to make your dreams come true. “It’s inexpensive, bright, and easy to make,” she said.*

*Clam and Chouriço Dressing*

*“It’s actually called the clam dressing,” Melissa said. “I heard somewhere in California that they use that dressing to make clam chowder, so I made a lemon-garlic chowder, and I was like, that’s a perfectly good name for the dressing. So I thought, let’s be true to the meal that we’re eating.”*
### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

* 1 teaspoon lemon juice

* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Freshly ground black pepper

* 2 lemons

* 1/2 cup Chouriço, fresh garlic chilies, seeds removed and julienned

* 2 English muffins
### Directions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the olive oil, mustard, lemon juice, salt, and pepper over medium heat. Whisk to combine. Add the lemons and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil is completely melted, about 2 minutes. Add the choucroute and cook, stirring constantly, until the choucroute is warmed through, about 1 minute.

1. Transfer the choucroute to a bowl. Warm the English muffins in a large skillet over medium heat, until slightly dry and browned, about 3 minutes. Stack the English muffins on one another, spoon the choucroute over the English muffins, and serve warm.
