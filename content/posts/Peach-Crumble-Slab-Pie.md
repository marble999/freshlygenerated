*My husband loves peaches, but when peaches are a little bit of a mess, he shies away. He sees them as a food to be cleaned up, whether from slicing or from peeling. So when I started making their gorgeous skin into bread, he was onboard. We decided to make this recipe even better by adding Greek yogurt and cantaloupe chunks to each slice of pie, and I think it turns out better every time. Because, after all, peaches are the best food on earth.*

*Layers of ripe peaches and Greek yogurt and a scoop of bright fruit are then rolled into little slabs on a hot cast-iron pan with a sweet sprinkle of cinnamon. Serve them on a huge plate in the kitchen with a shot of whatever hot coffee you can get your hands on.*

*Yield: 10*
### Ingredients

* 2 pounds peeled and quartered peaches

* 1Â½ cups heavy cream

Â½ cup Greek yogurt

Â½ teaspoon cinnamon

* 1 teaspoon nutmeg

Â¼ teaspoon cloves

* 8 slices French baguette, cut in half horizontally

* 1 cup pecan halves, toasted

* 1 ripe cantaloupe, peeled, seeded, and diced (about Â¾ cup)

* 1 cup sliced blueberries (about Â½ cup)

Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
### Directions

1. Heat a nonstick cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the cream, yogurt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream has bubbled and set, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the peaches. Transfer the cream mixture and peaches to the pan of warm cream and spread the peaches evenly.

1. Toast the baguette slabs in a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut the slabs in half horizontally, and place on top of the peaches. Roll the bread in the remaining cream mixture until the slices are fully coated. Serve the slices sprinkled with the pecan halves, the cantaloupe, the blueberries, and the sea salt and pepper, drizzled with olive oil if you like, and a squeeze of lemon.
