*That’s right. Today’s soup has a really sweet flavor! It’s best as an accompaniment to roasted veggies or salads. I love this soup so much that I make it for myself.*

*The best part of cooking butternut squash this way is that it’s way more versatile. It can be used in a double scooped dish, like Creamy Butternut Squash Soup, for that sweet mix of sweetness and spice, which I use throughout my dishes.*

*You’ll also need to refrigerate and bring the soup for the dish with some time to thaw the squash. Don’t throw it out! Let it sit for at least two hours or overnight to keep the butter from absorbing and breaking the tender, delicious squash apart.*

*Storeable Substitute:*

*Creamy Butternut Squash Soup with butter*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 small butternut squash, peeled and diced

* 8 garlic cloves, finely chopped

¼ cup finely diced onion

* 1/4 cup diced red bell pepper

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

¼ cup brown sugar

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon ground allspice

* 1/4 teaspoon paprika

* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves

* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

* 1 tablespoon ground nutmeg

Salt and pepper
### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease 2 soup bowls with butter. Chop and sauté the onion in the olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the squash and garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

1. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring the pot to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the squash is very tender and all the liquids have reduced. Enjoy immediately.
