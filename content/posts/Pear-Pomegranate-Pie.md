*Pears are one of the most versatile fruits for our cookbooks, and this ever-popular dessert can be made with any variety. Whether you have grown your own or are buying a frozen pear that has been baked, you'll probably be able to get your hands on one of the following recipes: Blackberry Pomegranate Pie, Heirloom Raspberries with Pomegranate, Whole Asparagus with Pomegranate and Fresh Strawberries, and Pear-Pomegranate Winter Cake.*

*Lauren Napier went straight for the pomegranate and took advantage of this bulbous fruit's inherent sweetness. Just as the pear fruit will remain whole and soft, so too will this slice be plump and juicy.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 teaspoon soy sauce

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil, like coconut or olive oil

* 3 cups pear flesh, diced

* 4 pomegranates, seeded and chopped
### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Combine the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and 3 pomegranates in a medium-sized bowl. Pour the mixture over the pear, letting it soak through the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350Â°F. Layer the rest of the sliced pears and pomegranate mixture into the crust. Return to the oven for 10 minutes more, or until the topping is golden brown.

1. Extra Considerations:

1. Prep time: 20 minutes

1. Cook time: 20 minutes

1. Recommended Method:

1. Because the pears stay fully intact once baked, the pie should be easily torn open and eaten. However, if you wish to yield to your inner prune, you can cut a small section out of the middle of the fruit, so that you can accommodate a layer of the pears and pomegranate slices. If you're unable to bend over, run your fork through a small hole at the bottom of the fruit and remove the crust. Don't wait to the last minute to eat your fruits and cream, however.
