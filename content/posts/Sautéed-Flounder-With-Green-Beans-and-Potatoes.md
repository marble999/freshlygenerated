*I don't have the willpower to eat a massive steak dinner every night. Or, as I like to call it, "going on a diet" so I can eat what I want when I want it. The only time I try to work it into my routine is when I am in the mood for something light. Lightness allows me to indulge in my love of wild things. Wild things like vegetables! How nice to enjoy whole plant foods like vegetables for once!*

*We have a family recipe that is perfect for comfort food but is light enough to eat whenever it feels like celebrating after a long day at work. And it is not in a hippie-dippy alternative farm setting but at home at my kitchen table with my family.*

*SautÃ©ed Flounder With Green Beans and Potatoes*

*Serves 4*
### Ingredients

Â¼ cup olive oil

* 2 cups cooked wild rice, chilled

* 3 cups tender flounder fillets, crusted and split

Salt and pepper

Â¼ cup chopped leeks

Â¼ cup chopped shallots

* 1 clove garlic, minced

* 1 cup white wine

* 2 tablespoons fresh dill

* 1 lemon, zested

* 6 green beans, trimmed and halved lengthwise

* 4 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into wedges
### Directions

1. 1. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 cup wild rice and sautÃ©, stirring often, for about 3 minutes. Add remaining wild rice, salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until translucent and almost all liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.

1. 2. Add 2 cups trout fillets, season with salt and pepper and sautÃ©, stirring, for 4 minutes, until tender and lightly browned on the outside.

1. 3. Add 1 cup chopped leeks, 1 clove garlic, shallots, white wine, and dill to wild rice mixture and stir. Add remaining trout fillets, season with salt and pepper and return to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until desired thickness is reached, about 5 minutes.

1. 4. Add lemon zest and another tablespoon olive oil to skillet and cook for 3 minutes over medium heat. Add beans and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add green beans and potatoes to skillet and toss to coat with lemon butter. Stir in remaining lemon butter and serve.

1. I hope you enjoy this beautiful light dish as much as I do.
