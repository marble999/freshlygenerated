*Instagram YET another version of wine syrups and there are a lot of different flavors. But don’t let the name fool you. It’s a syrupy treat, just like the wine itself.*

*It’s also fantastic for desserts, being the simplest and sweetest drink to make. For those who need a bit more flavor, just add more red or white wine. This is a fantastic drink to accompany cocktails and desserts, especially lighter eaters such as myself.*

*The most basic recipe is easy to make. You’ll need some white wine, candied ginger, brown sugar, vinegar, and water. If you’re looking for a dessert syrup to go over freshly baked cookies, ask your store’s bakery department. For something more decadent, use a bottle of bourbon or chardonnay, and serve it over fruit salad or as a dessert mixer.*
