*Clams in a Can*

*At the turn of the 20th century, Clam collars made a splash in the music world as recording artists such as Fats Domino and The Carpenters sang the perfect tune for their song "That One Hour" and recorded by nearly every major artist of the day. Enthusiasts believe that the clams in a can was the first known product of this new gimmick.*

*Today, clams in a can sells worldwide. The canned version contains 10 of the most popular clam species from Brittany to Oregon, including:*

*Byshyn (Caulfield) Clams*

*Cory Browne Clams*

*Clam;s Geoffery Clams*

*Cotton Clams*

*Crasson Clams*

*Crasson Ân' Turkish Clams*

*Croci Clams*

*Don't forget to pack a can opener with you in the car. At first glance, the clams in a can are a bit inconsistent, but we like the cold attitude of the container. These tart clams are perfect for a picnic, on a bed of gravel, in the backyard, in the sun. Chomp away!*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 ounce of clam powder

* 3 tablespoons of salted water

* 1 tablespoon of corn starch

* 1 tablespoon of flour

* 1 tablespoon of liquid honey

* 1/4 cup of sea salt

* 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda

* 1/2 tablespoon of black pepper

* 2 cups of in-shell mollusks
### Directions:

1. In a pot, add clam powder, water, corn starch, flour, liquid honey, salt, baking soda, and pepper. Then, set over low heat until the mixture boils and reaches 185 degrees. After 5 minutes of cooking, take the pot off the heat and carefully submerge the in-shell mollusks into the water to absorb most of the water.

1. After 25 minutes, take the clams out of the water and place them in a towel to cool. Then, wrap each clam in a paper towel and set them in a refrigerator for another 15 minutes before removing them from the paper towel and cutting the mixture into clams.
