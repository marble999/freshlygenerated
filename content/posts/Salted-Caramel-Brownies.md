*It doesn't get much more Instagrammable than this chocolate brownie with caramel, pecans, and whipped cream. Here's a recipe from Lindsey Palmer, dessert chef at Blue Agave in New York City and author of A Classic Pumpkin Baking Book.*
### Ingredients

:

* 3 sticks unsalted butter, cut into cubes

* 2/3 cup granulated sugar

* 2 eggs

* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (1/2 cup)

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

* 1/2 teaspoon salt
### Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease an 8-inch cake pan, and set aside. In a bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, until a soft but fluffy meringue forms. Beat in the chocolate chips.

1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, and whisk together just until combined. Using a large metal spoon, stir in the melted chocolate. Divide among the prepared pan. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until the tops begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Cool completely before serving.

1. Variations:

1.  *  May omit the butter and replace with powdered sugar or golden brown sugar; pour it on top of each cake as an accent rather than topping; add whipped cream

1.  *  Cover and refrigerate before baking to let its flavor adapt to the time.
