*Think of them as a Chablis: rich and fruity in all the right ways. Whether or not you like serious wines, the orange-saffron yogurt should be your first go-to low-calorie dessert drink.*

*This simple and satisfying treat stands up beautifully on its own, or, of course, as a lovely side dish or dollop atop a savory salad.*

*Of course, you can make this recipe at a leisurely pace, but if you are pressed for time and only have half an hour to prepare the rest of the ingredients, then follow this.*

*Caramelized Beets With Orange-Saffron Yogurt*

*Serves: 4*
### Ingredients

* 4 beets

* 1 1/2 cups orange-saffron yogurt

Salt

* 8 fresh figs, split in half lengthwise

* 1 teaspoon orange-saffron syrup

* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
### Directions

1. Put the beets in a medium-sized pot with enough water to cover the beets by an inch. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer, and cook, covered, for 40 to 45 minutes, or until beets are tender.

1. Let beets cool, then cut each beet into two-inch cubes.

1. Place orange-saffron yogurt in a blender or food processor and process, until smooth. Season yogurt with salt.

1. Put figs in a small baking dish. Put yogurt and orange-saffron syrup in a small bowl, and sprinkle over figs.

1. Put cheeses in a small dish and sprinkle over both cheeses. Drizzle a bit of orange-saffron syrup over the cheeses.

1. Divide between 4 dessert plates. Serve immediately.
