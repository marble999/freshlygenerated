*Twist your spring into shape with these tasty tidbits of fun baked gribenes.*

*Since 2013, Gribenes & Schmaltz Market & Kitchen has served up creatively flavored cakes, whoopie pies, and desserts.*

*We tested their aftershave and topped sweet rolls with Schmaltz.*

*This recipe is based on the Schmaltz bar recipe we found on The New York Times' website.*

*-- Melissa Clark*

*From Gribenes & Schmaltz Market & Kitchen, New York, NY*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 Â½ cups granulated sugar

* 1 Â¼ cups fresh milk

* 4 eggs

* 1Â½ teaspoons vanilla extract

* 1 Â¼ cups cream

Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

Â½ teaspoon ground nutmeg

* 1 teaspoon baking powder

* 1Â½ cups all-purpose flour

Â½ teaspoon salt

* 1 cup Schmaltz sauce

* 4 bars of dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

1. Mix sugar and milk in a large bowl.

1. Pour half of the milk mixture into a small casserole or freezer-safe container.

1. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and flour. Fold flour mixture into the bowl containing the milk mixture.

1. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until a paste is formed. Fold in the chocolate, and then transfer to a baking sheet.

1. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the top is golden. Cool completely before cutting. Store in an airtight container for up to three days.

1. I love Schmaltz for many reasons, but more than anything it's for how the flavor itself pours out of the tablespoon-sized cubes.
