*Before I even had dinner, the kitchen was aglow with the smell of my own cooking. To make a difference in the earth, it's worth concentrating on who you're treating, and who is coming in to eat that night.*

*I love cooking dinner for my husband, when it's time to tell him that I'm leaving him alone to kill another two fish for dinner and a glass of fizzy wine. He immediately grumbles, "No me gent!" Usually I'm on a mission to cook a meal that I'm dying to eat and he's one of the lucky people to eat it. Last weekend when we indulged in a special dinner for one, we couldn't have been happier. Not only do we love to do this -- we LOVE to do it. Not only do we still eat all of the good food that we grow, we tend to only cook once a week so that we can plan ahead. It works so well that last night's dinner of fish in white wine was specifically ordered a week or so earlier. That's only two meals a week right there.*

*Entertaining tip: Invite friends over for an evening of home cooking and listening to some great music. Have delicious menu items ready and deuced to go. Open a bottle of wine.*

*Date night can be really fun, especially when you are planning the menu well in advance. I often highlight a favorite red wine at the end of the meal, much like my favorite recipes.*
