*This actually predates the glam-grilled-pork-chop retro-soul of celebrity chef Jaleel White, but it is definitely making a comeback. You’ll still spot cast-iron tines on steakhouses and high-end Vietnamese restaurants, but now there are a variety of ways to use it: with sliced vegetables in a Southwestern salad; seared slices of beef, chicken, or shrimp, griddle-baked and adorned with smoky Thai chili glaze; and slices of steak that are braised in a rice wine and chicken stock until plump and tender, then served hot and lingering on a bed of fresh corn and baby peas. Here’s one version from Dan Loughery of Federalist Steakhouse, 150 E. 93rd St.*
### Ingredients

* 1 beef round steak, about 6 to 7 ounces per side, 8 to 10 inches long

Kosher salt

Extra-virgin olive oil

* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce

* 4 tablespoons rice wine vinegar

* 3/4 cup chicken stock

* 4 sprigs fresh mint

Fresh cilantro for garnish

Sriracha sauce for garnish
### Directions

1. 1. Cut steak on the diagonal in half down the center. Pull out the stem with your fingers to allow for easy cooking. Rub both sides of beef with salt, and season with the soy sauce and rice wine vinegar.

1. 2. Place meat on a plate and grill over direct heat on med-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until meat is browned on both sides.

1. 3. To serve, spoon your favorite salad onto a plate, lay the beef, sauteed in oil and soy sauce, on top, then top with some extra mint and cilantro. Top with Sriracha on the side.
