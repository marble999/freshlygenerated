Welcome to Freshly Generated! This site contains hundreds of recipes generated by a [machine learning model](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) for your amusement and (hopefully) your cooking pleasure. The titles and images are scraped from the New York Times Cooking section, but the recipes themselves were not written or curated by humans in any manner. 

If you're interested in the specifics on the machine learning side, we used [Grover](https://github.com/rowanz/grover) to generate articles in the style of author Melissa Clark from the New York Times Cooking section. We generate articles one (sub)word at a time; for example, the model might generate the word "Ingredients", then a bullet point character, then the word "2", then the word "ripe", then the word "apples", and so on. We continue this process until a special end-of-article word is generated. 

If you decide to make any of these recipes, [let me know](mailto:lmelaskyriazi@college.harvard.edu)! 

Enjoy! 

\- [Luke](https://github.com/lukemelas) and [George](https://github.com/marble999)
