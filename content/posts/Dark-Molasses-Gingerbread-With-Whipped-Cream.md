*For this easy dessert, you might want to let the turkey roaster brown a bit longer and leave out the eggs to get a nice golden brown crust. Basted in egg yolks with the browned turkey roaster juices, the gingerbread incorporates aromatics and a bit of a rich flavor. The Whipped Cream adds a creamy finish to the already moist crust.*

*Serves 4-6*
### Ingredients

* 1 turkey roast, in any shape, bone-in with the skin removed, 15 to 16 ounces, marinated 4 to 5 hours in 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon hot mustard, and 2 tablespoons of golden brown sugar

* 2 tbsp. sour cream

* 1 clove garlic, crushed

* 3 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh ginger

* 2/3 cup dark molasses

* 2 cups whole milk

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

* 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt

* 1 cup freshly whipped cream
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 F. Brush the exterior of the turkey roast on all sides with the leftover sauce, placing it on a cookie sheet to dry out. In a large bowl, combine sour cream, the garlic, ginger, and a 1/2 cup of water. Let sit for 1 hour.

1. In a bowl, combine the browned turkey roast, flour, salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir well, being careful not to over combine.

1. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the 2 cups of browned turkey fat and 1 cup of boiling water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the fat has completely melted and the pan is as dry as a tack (it should be about 50 percent dry). Remove from heat and set aside.

1. Fold the milk into the liquid fat and set aside to cool.

1. Once the turkey has cooled completely, pat it dry with paper towels.

1. In the same saucepan used to melt the turkey fat, heat the rest of the 2 cups of browned fat until very hot and bubbling. Increase the heat to high and cook the mixture until the mixture has melted. The total cooking time should be 3 to 4 hours. (The roasting is not required.)

1. Once the turkey has cooled completely, pat it dry with paper towels.

1. Transfer the roast to a rimmed baking sheet, lifting the dry edges. The oven will need to go a few degrees slower than you would normally if you were roasting the turkey ahead of time, and the turkey will need to be covered.

1. Place the roast on the roasting rack in the top third of the oven, in a cake pan, and roast for about 1 1/2 hours. (The oven needs to go a few degrees slower than you would normally to allow the turkey to brown. At 1 1/2 hours, the turkey should be golden brown on the top and sides.)

1. While the turkey is roasting, in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the browned turkey fat and milk. Stir constantly until mixture boils and begins to bubble (this will take several minutes). Remove from heat and set aside.

1. As soon as the turkey comes out of the oven, remove it from the rack and invert onto a plate. Place the whole roasting pan in the oven to finish roasting the turkey in total.

1. Continue to bake the turkey for another 1 1/2 hours, until the internal temperature measures 165 F. Remove from oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve in basting dishes with the Whipped Cream.
