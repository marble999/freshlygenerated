*There's something oddly satisfying about giving a stuffed boneless turkey breast with wine-gravy a taste test. It's not just that the whole turkey is full of delicate skin but that the chicken-like texture and gloriously moist meat make the breast seem like a breakfast entree. When I get my sons a mashed potato with a giblet gravy, I'm thinking I just can't get enough. Turkey is another story. But at the end of the day, I want it as something really fatty and rich like a chorizo sausage. Add some extra veggies, and maybe a bowl of soup and that doesn't seem quite as bad for you. I guarantee the bonus calories and fat will soon be too much to stomach. But that's the point: it makes me want to embrace this other Thanksgiving tradition with all the vim and vigor I can muster. Who doesn't?*

*Stuffed Boneless Turkey Breast With White Wine Gravy*
### Ingredients

For the sauce:

* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

* 1 teaspoon dried oregano

* 2 teaspoons minced garlic

* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

* 1/4 cup white wine, preferably domestic

* 3 tablespoons whole milk

* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the stuffed turkey breast:

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 2 pounds boneless turkey breast breast

Salt and black pepper

* 4 teaspoons fresh minced thyme

* 1 tablespoon dried oregano

* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary

* 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
### Directions

1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oregano and garlic and sautÃ© until the garlic is fragrant and the oil is colorfully scorched and toasty brown, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour on top of the garlic and garlic mixture and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in the wine, milk, thyme, salt, and pepper and remove from the heat. Cover the pan and let the sauce simmer, partially covered, until it thickens, about 30 minutes. Prepare an oven to 400 degrees F. Place the turkey breast on a foil-lined baking sheet and rub with the garlic mixture. Season the turkey breast with salt and pepper. Carefully remove the cover from the pot and pour the sauce over the turkey breast. Roast, rotating the oven rack so the roast is centered over the wine sauce, until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey breast registers 170 degrees F, about 35 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Remove the turkey breast from the oven, cut a large sliver off the sides of the cavity and scoop out the giblets and liver. Discard the remaining stuffing. Serve the turkey breast and sauce over the reserved stuffing, garnished with fresh thyme.
