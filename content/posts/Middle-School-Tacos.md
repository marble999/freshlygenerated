*Now that the weather is finally springing up, it's time to get outside again. The most original play dates of the season happen this time of year, when your toddlers are old enough to let loose and soak up the sun. But just because their turn comes, doesn't mean they're going to play outside. (Don't worry. You probably aren't as bad as these mothers.)*

*On warm evenings you can head out for a stroll in the park, or jump into the water. But instead, why not bring those small brains outside? My kids don't have cars yet, so they don't go to day care for four hours a day, as they could with older children. Instead, we've taken them to local farmers markets. (Hey, it's mom and dad's money, not theirs!) And on the weekends, my kids will sometimes pile into the car for an hour to go swimming at the public pool or to go on a run.*

*No matter how much you love their adventure, it's always nice to get some sun in the daytime, too. While my kids love to chase the cool, cold wind outside, I've discovered that the perfect kickoff to a sun-filled day is homemade meals. Whether they're tacos, quesadillas, or even grilled cheese sandwiches, they're sure to tickle their tastebuds -- and make for a good time.*

*Try this recipe for tacos with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and the best part: homemade tortillas.*

*Middle-School Tacos with Tomatoes, Onions, Cilantro, and Homemade Tortillas*

*By Michelle Gudelman*

*Servings: 6*

*Total time: 50 minutes*

*Cooking time: 20 minutes*
### Ingredients

* 12 soft corn tortillas

* 2 jalapeÃ±o chiles, de-seeded and sliced, with all seeds removed

* 1 onion, thinly sliced

* 1 (15-ounce) can chopped tomato paste

Â½ red bell pepper, seeded and diced

* 1 (8-ounce) can peeled and diced jalapeÃ±o peppers

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 tablespoon olive oil

* 1 (6-ounce) can chopped pimiento

* 1 lime, cut into wedges

Optional: Â¼ cup minced cilantro
### Directions

1. Place all the ingredients for the tacos in a large mixing bowl. Toss well with a fork. Roll the tortillas to help achieve uniform bites; if needed, thinly slice each roll and place on a plate. For best results, place the tortillas on a baking sheet to dry before placing on a large grill. Baste the tortillas with olive oil and lime juice to prevent burning. Heat the tortillas on the grill for about 2 minutes or until brown and warmed through. (Some think that slicing them on the diagonal also helps.) To assemble the tacos, place the jalapeÃ±o slices onto a large plate, and spread each with a small amount of cilantro. Top with a tomato slice and a spoonful of the salsa.
