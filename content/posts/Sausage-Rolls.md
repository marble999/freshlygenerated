*When hankering for a snack, we don't have to look far. It is one of the staples of our diets that we are bombarded with advertisements for all sorts of flavors and ingredients -- including spicy, hoppy mustard, homemade pizza, crisped-up baked potato bites, and blue cheese. There is no shortage of ways to present this staple, but many simply use frozen, pre-made sausage.*

*But so long as the sausage is delicious, homemade sausage rolls are easy to make. Let's start by defining: Pulled pork is pork, properly sauteed, then slightly warmed to serve, typically with coleslaw, and just enough spiced-up sauce. Spicy sausage rolls, which we do not consider mustard, are made in a similar fashion and are sometimes used to eat at street fairs.*

*Once the sausage is sliced, we add a cooked egg to create a sandwich-like effect. This is a fun addition to a breakfast sandwich that does not require a lot of work.*

*For perfect "pork" delights, season the rolls with freshly ground black pepper, paprika, a little salt, a bit of pepper, honey, lots of mustard (e.g., Dijon mustard), and beefy herbs.*

*Sausage Rolls*

*Also used as a filling for soups, casseroles, and stews. You can save the filling for the egg and roll it up, but for our recipe, it is easier and more delicious to use the filling for the roll.*

*Yield: 4-6*
### Ingredients

* 10 ounces hot dog strips

* 1.5 ounces finely ground smoked sausage, or 2 oz packed firmly packed ground pork

* 1/2 ounce salt

* 1.5 ounces red pepper flakes

* 2 eggs, beaten

* 1.5 ounces sweet relish, lemon or yellow, finely chopped
### Directions

1. 1. Lightly oil a baking sheet or rimmed baking pan.

1. 2. Slice sausage lengthwise on the bias. Separate the sausage into half-moon-shaped slices, and use the biscuit cutter to cut the slices into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.

1. 3. Place sausage rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Arrange rings of egg around the sausage, and sprinkle the eggs with ground black pepper, paprika, salt, pepper flakes, and red pepper.

1. 4. Bake for 15 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
