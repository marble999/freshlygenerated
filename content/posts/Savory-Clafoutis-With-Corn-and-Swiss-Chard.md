*After a few days of eating healthy foods, you probably feel like you should add a little bit of sweetness to your diet too. Enter the custard-flavored clafoutis and their wondrous purple hue. It’s all about a wonderfully rich custard, lightening the load of ingredients needed to dole out a sort of luxe dessert.*

*This savory version of clafoutis combines a puréed sauce with Swiss chard, corn, and black truffle for such an intriguing meal. A minor quibble is that the chard stalks end up being chopped off in the process — but even if they did get left out, it still would be a treat. After all, this kind of bite-size cornmeal pudding can just pack a powerful flavor punch.*

*Serves 4*
### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 3 tablespoons butter

* 1 large yellow onion, cut into 1-inch chunks

* 4 cloves garlic, crushed

* 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks

* 1 baguette, cut in half crosswise

* 1 medium-sized bunch chard, trimmed and chopped into 2-inch pieces

* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

* 2 teaspoons dried thyme

Salt and pepper

* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

* 1 cup crème fraîche

* 2 tablespoons double cream

* 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

* 1/2 cup black truffle oil

* 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese

* 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives or chopped fresh parsley
### Directions

1. Heat oil and butter in a large sauté pan. Add onions and cook over medium heat until translucent and slightly browned, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute longer.

1. Add carrots and cook 2 minutes, stirring. Stir in bread and chard, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until vegetables are soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in flour, thyme, and lemon juice. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
