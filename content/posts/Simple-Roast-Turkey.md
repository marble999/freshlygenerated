*Over the last several weeks, more and more e-mails have arrived about our food challenge. Why does Roast Turkey pack a punch? Roast Turkey is a stand-alone dish and is ideally served with sides. Yet, it is sweet. And white.*

*Roast Turkey, which involves caramelizing the roast turkey, is a weighty dish. I've made it over and over and always come out lighter. The recipe I use here is adapted from Lynn Crawford's restaurant column in Vancouver Life. The white flavor of the roast slowly caramelizes into a delicious sauce.*

*It's Thanksgiving time again. We've finally learned that there are ways to be more sensible about what we eat. It's also silly to focus on the minute changes in the size of a turkey. Cutting your turkey down to a smaller size won't improve taste. And neither will stuffing the bird.*

*This recipe was as indulgent as my dreams of the holidays. It was served with crackers and lots of mashed potatoes and carrots. My husband thought it was perfect -- despite, or perhaps because of, the amount of fattening stuff it contains. My daughter mused: "That's a turkey! That's full of meat."*

*How often do you get a chance to do this? If you really want to indulge, try adding pepitas to your preparation. They are a nutty seed that you can grind yourself or buy pre-ground and grind in a spice grinder.*
