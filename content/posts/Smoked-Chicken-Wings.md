### Ingredients

* 1/4 cup plus 4 tablespoons olive oil

* 4 pounds chicken wings

Salt and pepper to taste

* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Olive oil

* 8 flour tortillas

Salsa verde

* 6 large limes

Lemon wedges

Garnish

Olive oil

* 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

* 3 poblano chiles, stemmed, seeded, and chopped

* 1 cup chopped fresh mint

* 2 shallots, peeled and chopped

* 2 garlic cloves, minced

* 2 tablespoons rosemary leaves

* 2 tablespoons crumbled red chile pepper (or to taste)

Olive oil

* 2 teaspoons sugar

* 2 pounds Spanish chorizo

Freshly chopped cilantro to garnish
### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

1. In a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat, place the olive oil. Season the chicken wings generously with salt and pepper. Begin to cook the wings until they are almost completely cooked, about 15 minutes, depending on their size. Add the cayenne and cook for another 5 minutes, or until fragrant.

1. While the wings are cooking, open up the tortillas, allowing all the liquid to escape. With a slotted spoon, remove the cooked wings, then cut in half. Remove the skin from the wings, including the belly. Add the wings to the pan with the poblano chiles, then the leaves of the herbs, and the rosemary and garlic. (You will also need 2 tablespoons of olive oil for the dish.) Transfer the dish to the oven, then cover with foil and continue to cook for an additional 25 minutes.

1. Remove the foil, and invert the stuffed tortillas onto plates. Serve the stuffed chicken wings, over their shells, with salsa verde, toasted cilantro, and lemon wedges. This dish will make a nice brunch dinner if served in a large pot. For dinner guests, simply serve with rice and olives.
