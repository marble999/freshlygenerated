*Put your favorites together in this easy and entertaining dish that would make a fabulous party food. Couscous works well with chicken as it absorbs the flavors and the chicken doesn't get drowned out. Try this recipe with, say, tilapia, wild salmon, or tofu. Add lots of frozen whole green beans for an easy side dish.*

*Sesame Chicken With Cashews and Dates*

*Serves 4-6*
### Ingredients

* 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes

Salt

Pepper

* 2 tablespoons water

Freshly ground black pepper

* 2 tablespoons soy sauce

* 2 tablespoons sesame oil

* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

* 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar

* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

* 3 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained

* 1 cup frozen whole green beans, thawed

* 2 teaspoons sesame seeds

* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, plus additional for garnish
### Directions

1. Place the chicken pieces in a bowl, season with salt and pepper. Add the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, vegetable oil, vinegar, and lemon juice and mix well. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken for at least 2 hours, or up to overnight.

1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Add the chicken and cook until lightly browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside. Repeat with the remaining sesame oil and chicken pieces.

1. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the rice, cover the pan, and cook until the rice is tender and just about done, 8 to 10 minutes.

1. Remove the pan from the heat, and immediately pour off the excess water and drain the rice. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan over medium-high heat. Add the green beans and sautÃ© until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Pour the beans over the rice and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.

1. Once the rice is cooked, place the chicken, green beans, and sauce on a serving platter and garnish with sesame seeds, cilantro, and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.
