*There are a few important requirements when it comes to oysters. They must always be tied, they must always be shucked. Here, chef Tovah Matlin of the French Laundry shows us how to pierce the mollusk and close the shell. The shell is where the oyster fully opens up, revealing the meat inside. Depending on the size of the oyster, the final product will look like a spoon, a bowl, or a dollop. This dish, originally from Matlin’s cookbook, The French Laundry of the Oak Room, is meant to complement a plate of shrimp cocktail.*
### Ingredients

• 1 teaspoon cornstarch

• 2 teaspoons clarified butter

• 1 pound clams, cleaned and deboned

• Salt

• Freshly ground black pepper

• 2 tablespoons chopped parsley

• 1 cup mayonnaise

• 1 cup sour cream

• 1 cup chopped English peas

• Olive oil
### Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, clarified butter, and 1 teaspoon salt. Dip the shucked clams in the cornstarch mixture, leaving a thin layer on all sides, then fry the shell-side-down in boiling salted water until just tender. Remove the clams from the water, rinse with cold water, and drain on paper towels. Keep the shells in the fridge.

1. In a medium skillet, heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the parsley and English peas and sauté for a few minutes, until the herbs are softened. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.

1. Cook the clams in boiling salted water until just tender. Drain, then drain in a colander on paper towels. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the clams to the pot, and return to a boil. Remove from the heat, and transfer the clams to a plate lined with paper towels.

1. In a medium skillet, melt the clarified butter over medium heat. Add the clams and season with salt and pepper. Add the parsley-English pea mixture and cook for 1 minute.

1. To serve, ladle the oyster broth over each oyster, drizzle with the remaining clarified butter, and serve with lemon wedges and fresh flat-leaf parsley.
