*The franchise shares with us the fruits of its labour*

*Any mealworm can be referred to as an agege bread. An agege bread is a simple and delicious barley rice and chickpea pattie with four kinds of grains: barley, wheat, or ramush are examples.*

*The bread has all the qualities of a family meal: it is easy to work with and easy to prepare. It is nutritious, filling, and delicious.*

*And the best thing is that, it only has to be made once! Once is all it takes to start making these great healthy patties. For the record, each agege bread has a handcrafted message for you, and most are subject to a three-month change.*

*This bowl looks majestic but still packs an intimidating nutritional punch.*

*Preparation time: 5-10 minutes*

*Roughly 20 minutes cooking time*

*Hands on time: 1 minute*
### Ingredients

* 200 grams wide wide noodles, cooked

For the bread

* 50 grams broken wheat flour

* 50 grams graham cracker crumbs

* 250 grams cooked agesge grain

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 teaspoon tapioca flour

* 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup

For the sauce

* 150 grams rendered butter

* 2 lemons, zested and juiced

* 50 grams brown rice syrup

* 30 grams chopped garlic

* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
### Directions

1. To make the bread:

1. Mix the flakes of wheat in the graham cracker crumbs. Mix in the remaining wheat flour. Add the seasoned grains of proportions to the graham crumbs. For the recipe, make 3 to 4 cups of water and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the water to the flour mixture to make a lumpy dough. Allow it to rest for at least 5 minutes. If you like your rolls to be flaky, then the dough may not be chilled. Mix the grain mush and salt together. Transfer this mixture into a piping bag and shape it into a mini pattie. Transfer the frozen bread mixture onto a parchment lined tray and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for about 7-10 minutes, or until the bread puffs and is golden. To make the sauce:

1. Smash the butter into the saucepan with a spoon. Add the lemons, lemons zested and juiced. Mix in the brown rice syrup, garlic, and ginger. Continue to cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Mix in the cooked grains of the pastries until the mixture is smooth. Transfer this mixture into a pot, and allow it to boil on medium heat. Top of the skewers with the toasted wheat sesame seeds, and serve.
