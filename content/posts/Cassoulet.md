*The main component of this hearty dish is the braised pork, but you could also try the ham or chorizo. (By far the most robust choice, though, is the lamb.) The bulgur wheat lends a chewy texture and enriching moisture, and is a perfect foundation for the variety of beans you'll want to incorporate. (At Agria, the same pasta used is available in dried form.) This recipe is gluten-free, so you can, and should, use it as a dipping option for your scallop salad.*
### Ingredients

 *  1 can chickpeas, drained

 *  1 can lentils, drained and rinsed

 *  4 cloves garlic, minced

 *  1 dried red chile

 *  1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, leaves and flowers finely chopped

 *  Kosher salt

 *  5 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered

 *  1 1/2 lbs. pork roast, cut into 2-inch cubes

 *  1/2 cup dried bulgur wheat

 *  2 cups water

 *  1/2 cup olive oil

 *  1 1/2 tsp. dried red pepper flakes

 *  2 oz. ground dried chorizo

 *  2 tsp. smoked paprika

 *  2 tsp. smoked paprika

 *  2 tsp. dried oregano

 *  1/2 tsp. ground black pepper

 *  1 large onion, chopped

 *  1 1/2 cups chicken broth

 *  2 bunches fresh cilantro, chopped
### Directions

1. Put the chickpeas, lentils, garlic, chile, cilantro, potatoes, and any extra chopped vegetables, salt, bulgur wheat, water, olive oil, and dried herbs into a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender. Add the chorizo, smoked paprika, smoked paprika, and 1 teaspoon of the oregano and cook until the chorizo is toasted, about 5 minutes. The seasoning should be evenly distributed and will need to continue to simmer. Add the onion, reduce the heat to low, cover, and continue to simmer for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. (The aromatics should be very tender.) Add the remaining oregano and salt and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve immediately.
