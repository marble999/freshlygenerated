*This delicious soup is the perfect summer meal. Cilantro, which is a must have in almost all dishes, is the backbone to this delicious soup. The flavor of the tomato is complemented by cilantro, and the squash softens and blends together with the creamy ingredients. All this without much work. The best part is that you don't have to kill any bees; you just have to snap on a lid, take a sip, and voila. It's a recipe that makes you feel like you are breaking out of your shirt and shirt pants, if you know what I mean.*
### Ingredients

* 1 medium zucchini

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 1/4 cup chopped onion

* 1 jalapeÃ±o, seeded and chopped

* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped

* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

* 1 2-3 cups chicken stock

* 1 cup cooked and drained cannellini beans

* 1 to 2 ripe tomatoes, chopped

* 1/2 cup cilantro, roughly chopped
### Directions

1. Step 1: Halve the zucchini and scoop out the seeds and stringy stringy cores with a spoon. Cut the zucchini into small pieces and set aside.

1. Step 2: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

1. Step 3: In a large frying pan or a large pot, add the olive oil and sautÃ© the onion and jalapeÃ±o for about 2 minutes.

1. Step 4: Add the garlic and sautÃ© for 1 minute, and add in the oregano, black pepper, and ginger. Cook the mixture for 2 minutes, until the liquid in the pan is reduced by half. The aromatic mixture should smell smoky and grassy, with a slight but not overwhelming bouquet garni.

1. Step 5: Return the zucchini to the pan and drizzle the garlic-herb mixture over it. Once melted, mix with a spatula and cook for about 1 minute to get that lovely insides/flesh mixture out. Pour in the diced tomatoes and the cannellini beans, and cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.

1. Step 6: Remove from the heat, cover with a lid, and set aside for 20 minutes.

1. Step 7: To serve, heat the soup for 10 minutes, stirring every now and then, or until you get that delicious flavor. Ladle it into shallow bowls and top with chopped cilantro and garnish with a dollop of whipped cream if you'd like. Don't forget to garnish!
