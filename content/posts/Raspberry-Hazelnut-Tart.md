*One of my favorite things to eat has become my go-to dessert -- a little tray of this tart, too. The method changes depending on the thickness of the tart. You can freeze it and pull it out when it's a tad too thick. I typically use it in the springtime, which means more raspberries in the harvest season. You can use a fresh tart, or top it with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.*

*Serves 8*
### Ingredients

* 1 pint raspberries

* 1 cup hazelnuts, toasted

* 6 tablespoons sugar

Â½ vanilla bean, split

Â½ lemon, juiced

* 1 cup sour cream

* 2 tablespoons water

Â½ cup almond sugar

Â½ teaspoon kosher salt
### Directions

1. 1. In a bowl, mix together the raspberry juice, hazelnuts, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir to incorporate. Set aside.

1. 2. Slice the vanilla bean and half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Whisk in the vanilla bean. If you like, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of water to thin the mixture so you have a bit of a bean on each cookie.

1. 3. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the raspberry/nut mixture to a boil and remove it from the heat.

1. 4. In a bowl, combine the sour cream, water, almond sugar, and salt. Mix in the raspberry-nut mixture. Pour into a lined baking pan and freeze the tart.

1. 5. Let the tart rest 5 minutes. Invert the tart onto a baking sheet and let it set until the tart is set.

1. 6. Cut the tart in half and cut the top to one-third thickness. Top with the vanilla bean.

1. 7. Cut the other half in half and serve.
