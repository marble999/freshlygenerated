*Some of my favorite meals are actually cooking-based. When I go to the farmers market, I find myself cooking delectable meals out of just about every imaginable type of produce. On a recent trip to the grocery store, I came across a recipe for slow-cooked red chili turkey from Laura Werthmann's book, Smoked to Order.*

*This is one of those perfect recipes that can be modified to fit any one's needs. As is so often the case with seasonal produce, most of the flavor elements from the original recipe have to be left out. But this slow-cooked red chili turkey can be served over steamed cornmeal pilaf or mashed potatoes, with yogurt, a dollop of sour cream or a dollop of mayonnaise to cap off the flavors. But we had cornmeal pilaf on hand that day, and the rest of it can be used as the base for another dish: Shredded green chiles are chunky and add a nice heat, and anything stir-fried will also work.*

*Serves 6 to 8*
