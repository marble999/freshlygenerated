*On a glass table beside my desk, the bowl of autumn figs and candied apples from this season's fruit spread reads, "Dressy Minty Fruit Salad," as a tissue next to my tray of pumpkins wipes away tears. My glossy wet spread is strewn with freshly picked peaches, nectarines, peaches and apples. I fold my damp napkin, turn my head and start to croon. It's like all my internal monologue has played out into real life. This of course is the moment my least favorite nightmare has presented itself. And so I can only take consolation in the fact that other Maddy's pets in life don't love me.*

*By autumn, I am a reluctant diva. And yet every year I demand that everyone in my family join me at the caramel ice cream bar, a feast that we know will be laden with peaches, blueberries, apples, and almonds. The surprise isn't what it's packed with -- it's that I can't resist myself. It's a moment of self-absorption that I am in it, loving it, and so I love myself.*

*The press release pictures my toppings as fruit and I'm too busy to hate it -- even if I wish it didn't make me look like a cartoon. We all know how to put up a fight and why. It's nice to have this moment of lovableness -- and for everyone to know.*

*Recipe by Maddy Welch*
### Ingredients

Fruits:

Figs, fresh

Candied Apples, candied

The Roots of Autumn, jalapeÃ±os

Mint, optional

* 2 Cups ice cream (you can add more if you like)

* 3 Eggs

* 1 Stick unsalted butter

* 4/5 Cups whole milk

* 7 Tablespoons heavy cream

* 3/4 Cup light brown sugar

* 1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon

* 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

* 1 Teaspoon salt

Canola oil as needed
### Directions

1. Using a ricer, chop the cubed figs and candied apples. It helps to use prepared apples, as they soak up the apples juices better, and they take less time to peel. You can also experiment with ingredients you like better or sometimes just ignore them entirely. Experiment!

1. While the fruit is chopping, make the syrup. In a medium-sized saucepan, whisk together the sugar, milk, cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt until combined. Be aware that doing so may reduce the volume of the syrup by a little, but in the end it's the best.

1. Drop 2 Tablespoons of the syrup into the apple juice. Scoop the fruit pulp into a separate small saucepan and fry for 30 seconds, then add the pod to the syrup. Lastly, pour the hot fruit mixture back into the saucepan and stir in the canola oil. Mix well and add the egg, stirring with a whisk.

1. Brush a cookie sheet with a little canola oil and set it on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

1. Cover the cookies in the ice cream mixture and roast until the yolks begin to just start to pull away from the sides of the cookie, about 10-12 minutes. Let sit for a few minutes before using. The cookies will still be soft around the edges and will have a slightly chewy texture. Enjoy immediately.
