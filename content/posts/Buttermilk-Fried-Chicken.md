*When I moved to Connecticut a few years ago, I brought “Chipotle sauce” with me as I proclaimed that it was one of my favorite dishes — and it is.*

*I’m always tempted to dip into the fruity, slightly tart peppery sweet chipotle sauce without knowing where the ingredients came from. The scent quickly convinces me that I should pour this “secret sauce” over grilled chicken or chicken thighs, or maybe onto a baked potato. It blends well with many vegetables, too, as it doesn’t leave me overly overwhelmed with hot heat.*

*And for a definite novelty, you can spread the chicken onto flour tortillas and top them with melted cheese.*

*Yield: 2 servings*
### Ingredients

• 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

• 1 teaspoon minced fresh cilantro, plus more for serving

• Kosher salt

• 2 tablespoons mayonnaise

• Fresh lime juice
### Directions

1. 1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Brush chicken breasts with butter and season with cilantro, a pinch of salt, and a grinding of black pepper. Place chicken breasts in a baking dish, drizzle chicken with remaining ½ teaspoon butter, and roast for 5 minutes or until cooked through.

1. 2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lime juice, and cilantro. Serve chicken on tortillas with lime mayo on the side.

1. KELTY’S RECIPE

1. Pickled Watermelon Strawberries

1. For the pickling liquid

1. • 2 cups warm water (do not use boiling or this gives it a fishy aroma)

1. • ¼ cup chopped blackberries

1. • 2 tablespoons honey

1. • 2 teaspoons sweet pickling vinegar

1. For the berries

1. • 3 cups seedless, superfine watermelon juice

1. • 2 teaspoons almond extract

1. • pinch of crushed red pepper flakes

1. Directions

1. 1. In a saucepan, combine all the ingredients for the pickling liquid and stir until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the liquid thickens (this should take about 15 minutes). Remove from heat, cover, and set aside until ready to pickle the berries.

1. 2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine all the berries with the watermelon juice, almond extract, and crushed red pepper flakes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight) and pour the pickling liquid into sterilized glasses. Toss each glass in place of placing a butter knife into the liquid and let them sit for an hour, shaking the glasses regularly to distribute the pickling liquid around. Pour 1/4 cup of the pickling liquid into a small canning jar and fill with the pickled berries. (Make it with strawberries because the white salt and red pepper flakes will not gel in the canning liquid.)

1. 3. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 days. Serve in a bowl with spoon for dipping.
