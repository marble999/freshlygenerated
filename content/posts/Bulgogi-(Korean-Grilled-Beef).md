*Bulgogi--or grilled beef--is a delicious dish that is easy to make with meat and vegetables from a box or a jar. My family loves this delectable BBQ (BBQ) dish--especially the gochujang-infused tangy gochujang pepper sauce. I love using a jar of Chef's blend spiced-meat marinade on my bulgogi grill or slow cooker to get the perfect marinade balance. For this recipe, chef Bruce Wusta used a neutral flavor to make his marinade with seasonal produce like arugula, cherry tomatoes, and cucumbers.*
### Ingredients

:

* 4 boneless ribeye steaks, trimmed of fat and all internal fat

Handful of arugula

* 1 piece of tomato, seeded, finely diced

* 1 pack of cucumber, peeled, chopped fine

* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano

Â¼ cup grapeseed oil

Â¼ cup salt

Â¼ cup white wine

* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
### Directions:

1. Prepare the preheated grill for direct grilling. Use the grill's ventilation vents to pour off any air trapped under the grill. Keep the grill dry with a clean grill brush. Preheat the grill to 500Â°F (260Â°C). Tie the ends of the ribs with kitchen twine and place on a large plate and drip off any excess water. Place the quartered tomatoes and cucumber in a large bowl and let them cool. Reserve Â¼ cup of the chilled ingredients for garnish. Combine the remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Place a medium size grill pan over high heat until hot but not smoking. Season the bottom of the pan with the salt. Place the cooled tomatoes and cucumber and their marinade into the marinade mixture and shake to combine all ingredients. Pour the marinade mixture into the shallow pan and cover the pan tightly with foil. Heat the mixture over high heat for about 10 minutes or until the temperature reaches 350Â°F (175Â°C). Remove the pan from the heat and season with the remaining salt. Place the steaks on the grill, skin side down and grill, brushing from time to time with the marinade, until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of each rib bone registers 160Â°F (60Â°C), about 4 to 5 minutes.

1. Serve the halved steaks with the roasted tomatoes and cucumber.
