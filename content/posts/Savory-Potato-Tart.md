### Ingredients

* 2 to 3 medium to large baking potatoes, halved and thinly sliced crosswise

* 1 / 3 cup neutral oil

* 3 cloves garlic, minced

* 1 / 2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped

* 2/3 cup fresh thyme, roughly chopped

* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

* 1 pound bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces, preferably smoked

* 4 large eggs

* 1 / 4 cup heavy cream

* 1 / 3 cup frozen unsweetened organic (freshly cracked) coconut milk

* 1 cup heavy whipping cream

salt and pepper

* 3 / 4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, loosely packed

salt and pepper

* 1 / 4 cup slivered almonds
### Directions

1. Place the potatoes on a counter and sprinkle some salt over the bottom. Sprinkle another pinch of salt over the sides of the potatoes and cut a horizontal slit in the center, a few inches wide. Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the base of the potato halves and place them in a foil-lined baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook.

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

1. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil and cook the garlic until very fragrant and slightly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the garlic to a large bowl and add the parsley, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Add the bacon to the bowl and gently stir in the reserved potato florets, eggs, cream, coconut milk, whipping cream, and salt and pepper to taste.

1. Transfer the mixture to the baking dish and bake until the center is set and the potatoes are crisp and golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then spoon the filling into 6 pastry tins. Bake for another 20 minutes.

1. Remove the tins from the oven and top each with a layer of cheese. Then top each with a layer of remaining cheese. Remove the tins from the oven and set aside to cool completely.

1. Preheat the broiler.

1. Add the almonds to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds on high power.
