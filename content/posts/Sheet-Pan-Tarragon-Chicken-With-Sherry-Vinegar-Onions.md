*Serves 4*
### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon kosher salt

* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

* 1 whole chicken (about 2 pounds), cut into pieces

Freshly ground black pepper

Â½ cup white wine

* 6 ounces (about 1 cup) chicken broth

Â¼ cup balsamic vinegar

* 4 small sage leaves, finely chopped

* 1 shallot, finely chopped

* 1 shallot, finely chopped

* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

* 1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper

* 2 medium shallots, finely chopped

* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
### Directions

1. Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

1. Step 2: In a large bowl, combine the salt, pepper, chicken, white wine, broth, vinegar, and sage. Using your hands, pat the chicken dry with a paper towel, season it with salt and pepper, and set aside.

1. Step 3: Transfer the broth to a large baking pan and heat it over medium-high heat. The stew will be hot. Once it comes to a boil, it will boil down to a thick gravy and can be left to simmer for about 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and most of the fat has been absorbed. This makes more than you will need.

1. Step 4: While the chicken is simmering, chop the chicken into bite-size pieces and place them in a bowl of ice water. While that cools, slice 1/4 of the shallots into thin rings.

1. Step 5: Place the shallots, parsley, and cayenne in a shallow glass dish. Add the cooked chicken and gremolata to the bowl and toss everything together gently until combined. Serve warm.
