*Steak is a great choice for dinner when you are hungry in the spring, and this variation of the classic steak recipe is my favorite way to welcome the warm weather.*

*To get this salsa perfect, you need to prepare it in advance to allow for easy blending. When the steak has been broiled, just stir the salsa until it becomes thick and presents evenly on the grill. The mix of flavors will be evenly distributed in all areas of the grilled steak, and will create a succulent and satisfying meal for your family.*
