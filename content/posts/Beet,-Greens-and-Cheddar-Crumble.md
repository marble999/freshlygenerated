*Sometimes the sight of a giant beet can make you want to shove it down your throat like a ball of white dirt, and that's fine. But even if you can't stomach a juicy, crunchy swashbuckler, there's a healthier way to eat this spear. Don't let its scary appearance deter you: They're actually fiber-rich, too. I have one big reason to trust their chewy consistency -- I lived in a town with beet fields for a few years while college studying for a baking class. But they're surprisingly versatile: SautÃ© them with garlic and rosemary until translucent, drizzle with brown butter, and garnish with a slice of avocado to remind you how easy beet dishes are. And just before you eat, sprinkle them with feta, rosemary, and a dollop of balsamic vinegar.*

*Serves: 4-6*

*Start to finish: 1 hour 45 minutes*
### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs (recipe below)

* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

* 1 small onion, minced

* 6 small heirloom beets, peeled and roughly chopped

* 5 garlic cloves, minced

* 3 teaspoons rosemary, minced

* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

* 1 pound applewood smoked bacon, cut into small pieces

* 4 ounces cheddar cheese, grated (about 2 cups)

* 1/4 cup plain white or hazelnut-flavored yogurt

* 1 avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced (about 1/2 cup)

* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
### Directions

1. In a bowl, toss together the breadcrumbs, oil, onion, beets, garlic, rosemary, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread the beets in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and spread the sage herb mixture evenly over the beets. Refrigerate the beets, covered, for about 1 hour.

1. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until it is crisp and golden brown. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.

1. While the bacon is cooking, in a blender or food processor, combine the yogurt, avocado, cumin, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Blend until smooth. Drizzle the yogurt mixture over the beets and toss together until well combined.

1. Slice the beets and top each with dollops of yogurt, a slice of cheese, and a few greens, such as spinach, mustard greens, or chard. Toss lightly and serve.

1. Tip: For a more breadcrumb-intensive technique, place the beets in a brown paper bag and bake in a 400Â°F oven for 25 minutes.
