*Here is a great recipe for what I like to refer to as the slow dog, the ethnic dish that is traditionally a blend of national dishes.*

*Gyros is a Greek sandwich — dolma literally means “for the ox,” with name referring to the meat. The name makes little sense since the meat comes from the ox.*

*However, the name is really just a beautiful fusion of the Spanish ball pinto with the Middle Eastern beef and lamb. It’s a genuinely mouthwatering dish.*

*This Greek Gyro shows off its versatility. It makes a good wrap, it can be made vegetarian, and it is a great idea for a lazy Sunday picnic.*

*Gyros*
### Ingredients

• Kosher salt

• 1 ounce ground lamb

• 1 ounce ground beef

• 1-inch chunk of onion

• 5 green peppers

• 1/2 of a lemon

• 1/4 of a pepper

• 4 Tbsp olive oil

• 1 whole grain sauté pan

• 2 medium eggs
### Directions

1. Step 1: Place all meat in a large bowl and coat with salt.

1. Step 2: Cut lettuce and tomatoes into small dice, put on a plate.

1. Step 3: Heat olive oil in the sauté pan over medium heat.

1. Step 4: Add meat and diced vegetables to sauté pan.

1. Step 5: Add onions and season with salt and pepper. Do not allow it to get brown. Cook for 5-6 minutes.

1. Step 6: Remove, adding lemon and cumin seeds, salt and pepper to taste.

1. Step 7: Cook for another 4-5 minutes and add eggs to pan, mixing well.

1. Step 8: Transfer to a wrapped lettuce wrap.

1. Step 9: To finish and finish it up, toast tomatoes and arrange over the gyro, adding their olive oil.

1. The lack of a gyro shape is no big deal.
