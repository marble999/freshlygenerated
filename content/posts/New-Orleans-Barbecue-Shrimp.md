*Over the past few weeks, we've been whipping up some fun, interesting sounding dishes with the latest in cooking technology. When we asked you for ideas, we were swamped with recipes for all sorts of unconventional dishes. We can't wait to share what you did.*

*The most popular idea? Chicken necks. We've decided to create a whole dish using chicken stock and chicken necks to make shrimp with a very particular twist. We love how this adds a little mystery. Yup, you read that right. So here's to this whole family of shrimp toting jerky! We'll let you know when the recipe is ready.*

*About this recipe, Melissa Clark, Taste editor for New York magazine's The Cut:*

*In our weekly Eat Like a Man Facebook live, cooking blogger extraordinaire Anna Klassen shared her recipe for Porch Beef Short Rib Tenderloin with Filet Mignon. That version is juicy and delicious. Now, perhaps more than ever, a beef tenderloin needs something like this. The cheap cheap steak does not live up to its greatness.*

*We are very much leaning toward fried Louisiana ears of corn, which are my favorite traditional creation in New Orleans food. Our sauce-cooked nuggets are perfect for frying and sneaking in to these simple shrimp. We love to pair our Southerly variation with a little Southern fried pickles for some snappy flavor.*

*Serves 8.*
### Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided

* 1/2 pound shrimps, peeled and deveined

* 2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning

* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground pepper

Hot cooked Louisiana Sweet Honey Mustard (or regular mustard)

* 8 ears of corn, husked

* 2 pounds Louisiana Butter Roasted Corn or Texas Pan Rice

* 1-1/2 tablespoons olive oil

* 1 package smoked sausage, sliced into 8 thick slices
### Directions

1. 1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Season the shrimp on both sides with the Old Bay and kosher salt. Cook 2 minutes on each side, until opaque. Drain the shrimps on paper towels, then cut each one into 8 pieces. Set aside.

1. 2. In a medium bowl, toss the Louisiana sweet honey mustard with the cooked corn. Set aside.

1. 3. In the same frying pan, over medium-high heat, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Working in batches, add the sausage to the pan. Cook the sausage until the edges turn a little golden brown, about 5 minutes, then move it to a plate. Cook the remaining half-dozen pieces over medium heat until the sausage is browned on all sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the reserved sausage. Set aside.

1. 4. Prepare a baking sheet for four large shrimp each, by lining it with parchment paper and filling it with cold water. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp. Fry for 1 minute on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and immediately place over a large pile of the corn. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan over medium-high heat until hot. Turn off the heat and brush the butter onto the breaded shrimp. Place the pan back on the stove and bring the heat to medium. Put in the bacon. Cook for another minute until it browns. Lightly brown the chicken on both sides until golden, then return it to the pan.

1. 5. Carefully move the sweet honey mustard to the bottom of the pan. Add the shrimp on top of the butter-bacon. Drizzle the reserved hot honey mustard over the whole pan and place it over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, until the sauce is hot and bubbling. Cook for another minute or so, until the sauce thickens and starts to bubble. Cook until the popcorn starts to turn golden brown, then spoon over the fried shrimp and corn. Garnish with pickles and serve hot.
