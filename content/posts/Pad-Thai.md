*This Pad Thai is overstuffed with tasty ingredients—that and some spectacular browned shrimp lie at the heart of this recipe.*

*To make a dish this good at home, make these soy sauce and oyster sauces, then get your hands on fresh basil, pickled shallots, chicken, coconut milk, and egg—that and a good stock.*
### Ingredients

* 4 eggs

* 2 tablespoons sliced green onions

* 1/2 bunch chopped basil

* 1/2 bunch chopped mint

* 1 pound chicken, cut into chunks

* 2 cloves garlic, smashed

* 1 can (16 ounces) light coconut milk, divided

* 5 tablespoons packed light brown sugar

* 3 tablespoons sesame oil

* 1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

* 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

* 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

* 2 1/2 teaspoons finely grated peeled oyster sauce

* 1/2 teaspoon finely grated peeled oyster sauce

Sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

* 8 ounces peeled and deveined fresh shrimp

* 1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 6 pieces

* 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil an ovenproof pan and set aside.

1. Beat the eggs, 2 tablespoons green onions, and 2 tablespoons of the fresh basil in a small bowl. In a food processor, whirl together the chicken, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of the coconut milk, salt, pepper, sesame seeds, ginger, oyster sauce, and sea salt. Pour half of the shrimp mixture into the egg mixture; mix to combine. Pour the rest of the shrimp into the egg mixture, stir gently, and slide into the prepared pan.

1. Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the shrimp has increased in volume.

1. Serve, garnished with toasted sesame seeds.
