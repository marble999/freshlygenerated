*Remember this? It's the recipe that makes lemon butter simple and easy (though if you can't find it, it's a good substitute).*

*Serves 3 as a first course*
### Ingredients

* 3 (5-ounce) salmon fillets

* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

* 6 oz fresh tuna fillet

* 1/2 cup dry white wine

* 2 tablespoons flaked almonds

* 1 tablespoon chopped parsley

Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Lemon butter:

* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

* 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots

* 1/2 cup cream

* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

* 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
### Directions

1. To prepare salmon:

1. Slice off 2-inch sections of salmon.

1. Place the lemon juice and butter in a small saucepan. Place over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Set aside.

1. To prepare tuna:

1. Separate the tuna fillets into thin strips. Pour the wine into a pot with the shallots and use the back of a fork to squash the marinated shallots into the liquid. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced to 1/2 cup. Season with salt and pepper.

1. Set the tuna in a bowl with the sauce and about 2 tablespoons of the marinade. Let it marinate for 10 minutes.

1. Set the bowl and the tuna in a warmer place.

1. To prepare lemon butter:

1. Melt the butter in a small pan and stir in the lemon juice and parsley. Add the diced salmon and let it stand for 10 minutes.

1. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and arrange on a platter. Serve the salmon with the lemon butter. Serve the tuna fillets, too, on the side.
