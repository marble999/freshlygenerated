*For our recent meal test of the week (in response to a question from Tumblr user kimmabee), we scoured the internet to find “The No. 1 act of female liberation,” and our choice would have to be this simple potato soup, so, again, for your convenience, we did the cooking for you. The dish is everything I’ve always wanted a soup to be: homey, comforting, creamy, loaded with flavor, and it’s not even usually from a beloved American restaurant. Definitely a dish you can make on weeknights by yourself, and always great for a mom-daughter activity. If you like your life inspiring the next generation, even more so.*

*Serious Potato Skins*
### Ingredients

* 1 pound fresh potatoes

* 3 cups water

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

* 7 tablespoons butter

* 3 tablespoons flour

* 1 cup heavy cream

* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
### Directions

1. Cook potatoes in boiling salted water until fork tender. Drain, then let cool to room temperature.

1. Combine potatoes, water, salt, and apple cider vinegar in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Using a hand mixer, beat the butter with the flour until smooth. Add the cream, a ladleful at a time, and beat until smooth. Add the parsley and chives and mix well. Serve immediately.

1. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article listed cilantro instead of parsley as the addition of chives.
