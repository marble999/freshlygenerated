*The secret to chef Michael Anthony’s sashimi is in his sauce. “The sushi I start with is always so great that I start with the vinaigrette for the sashimi,” he says. The simple recipe for this light version is a fun appetizer.*

*Using a vegetarian chopping board, chop halved shallots, garlic, tarragon, and capers together to make a vinaigrette. Next, combine your béarnaise sauce with vegetable stock and 1½ tablespoons sake; place everything in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer for about three minutes. Transfer to a bowl and use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a serving platter to hold the heat. “The vinaigrette will keep for several hours in the refrigerator,” says Anthony. For dinner, simply reheat in a 200-degree oven for five minutes.*

*Sandra Mansfield Kim’s Serves 6*
### Ingredients

* 3 shallots, peeled and cut into rings

½ cup béarnaise sauce (see recipe)

½ teaspoon olive oil

* 2 large garlic cloves, cut into eighths

* 1 pound assorted vegetables, peeled and thinly sliced (eg, asparagus, carrots, celery, and cabbage)
### Directions

1. Coat your pan with olive oil. Add the shallots, garlic, and three-fourths teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons of béarnaise in a small pot and add the vegetables, stirring. Cook until vegetables are starting to brown. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, pressing down on the vegetables with a spatula to puree them into a dressing consistency.

1. Serve garnished with fried shallots.
