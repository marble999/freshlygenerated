*The typical Thanksgiving turkey takes days to prepare, but don't get stuck with an ugly, frozen bird. Cooks can slake your hunger and satisfy your appetite with this recipe from Chef Brett Davis of "Holidays, Food and Design with Brett Davis."*
### Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons canola oil, divided

* 1 tablespoon garlic, peeled and minced

* 1 jalapeÃ±o pepper, finely chopped

* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves

* 2 tablespoons flour

* 2 chickens (6 pounds each), skin removed and bones discarded

* 2 cups white wine

* 2 cups chicken broth

Salt and pepper to taste

Ingredients:

* 3 cups rice, uncooked

* 3 cups pearl barley, uncooked

* 2 cups drained, rinsed and chopped fresh veggies (kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, onions, etc.)

* 3 cups chicken broth

* 1/4 cup oil

* 1 tablespoon garlic, chopped
### Directions

1. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat half of the oil over medium heat. Add garlic and jalapeÃ±o, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until softened. Add thyme, flour, chicken broth and chicken, and stir to cook. Stir in rice and barley, cover and cook on low for 4 hours or until chicken is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine remaining oil, garlic and remaining jalapeÃ±o, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the rice and barley mixture, cover and cook on low for another 2 hours. When rice is done, add chicken broth, and cover. Cook for a few minutes, or until chicken is tender. Divide between bowls, top with veggies, and sprinkle with the remaining oil.
