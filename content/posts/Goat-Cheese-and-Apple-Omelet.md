*It's no secret that goat cheese has made a name for itself in the food world, gaining a new and buzzy status after starting its red carpet-ready career on TV show reality competitions (hello, Big Little Lies). But a playful Asian take on this buttery cheese is also easy to pair with many types of cooked foods. In this example, braised apple is paired with the goat cheese omelet, served with a drizzle of sweet citrus yoghurt and dried chamomile tea.*

*From a goat cheese and apple omelet to a goat cheese caramel dip, goat cheese has come a long way from those before sliced grapefruits and chantilly to the pancake sandwiches on fancy dinner plates with cheddar or parmesan cheese. In fact, in terms of its culinary savory qualities, goat cheese's claims to fame include its creamy, pillowy texture and its lactose-free texture. Goat's tangy, red-wine-like flavor is also huge, and the fresh leaves of arugula also offer a burst of bright flavor. Any of these features combined with the caramel-sweet notes of fruit -- a rich apple core and the tart, yellow rashers -- results in a meal fit for a trendy A-lister. Add in some perfectly poached pears and prepare for a satisfying, Instagram-worthy meal.*

### Ingredients

:

* 2 eggs

* 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed, drained

* 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar

* 1 tablespoon maple syrup

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

* 1 whole apple, coarsely grated (about Â½ cup)

* 1/4 cup packed fresh, mint leaves, plus extra sprigs

* 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar

* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

* 1/4 cup cooking oil (the same oil you'd use for the yolk of a stick of butter)

* 2 tablespoons orange zest, plus 1/2 lemon slice (for garnish)

* 10 to 12 cups cooked omelet

* 1/2 cup dried chamomile tea

* 1/4 cup crÃ¨me fraÃ®che

To serve:

Sliced pears, cassis vinaigrette (below) and dried chamomile tea

Balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
### Directions:

1. In a food processor, combine the eggs, capers, vinegar, maple syrup, and salt and pepper. Process for 3 minutes or until blended and voluminous.

1. In a large bowl, use a hand blender to combine the apples, mint, sugar, and flour.

1. Add the egg mixture and blending just until the all-purpose flour has been incorporated and the ingredients are slightly thickened. Add the oil, juice of one lemon, and orange zest. Season with more salt and pepper if desired.

1. Pour the egg mixture into an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Top the egg mixture with the orange zest and place the baking dish on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

1. Press down gently on the top of the dish to seal the pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the omelet is set and the middle of the omelet is set.

1. While the omelet is baking, whisk together the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, and a little water. Immediately pour the wet mixture onto the top of the omelet and bake just until the cheese is melted and the lemon wedges are slightly set, 3 to 5 minutes.

1. Remove the omelet from the oven and flip it over. Serve immediately with the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and lemon wedges.

1. Makes 8 servings.

1.  * If you can't find the tablespoon tart cherry chamomile water at your favorite Asian market, you can use 3 tablespoons hot water instead.

1.  * Once the goat cheese is set, it can be served warm or at room temperature (so it doesn't become too wet before being served). It can also be frozen in the refrigerator, and simply thawed in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds before serving.

1.  * The cherry tomato vinaigrette is a special-occasion recipe, so you can use store-bought vinaigrette instead.
