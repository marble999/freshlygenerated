*Often referred to as a "gooey butter cake," this recipe calls for a layer of clear, thick cream cheese frosting. It's needed to stop the cake from becoming soggy as it bakes. Whip up this cake mix.*

*Yield: 8-10 servings*
### Ingredients

* 2 eggs

* 1Â½ sticks unsalted butter, softened

* 1Â¼ cups sugar

Â¼ cup freshly grated orange zest

Â¼ cup all-purpose flour

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

* 1Â½ cups milk
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a 1-quart bundt pan.

1. Whisk eggs, butter, sugar, and orange zest in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in flour and vanilla extract. In a small bowl, whisk together milk and more orange zest, then pour over egg mixture; whisk until incorporated.

1. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

1. Trim edges; invert cake onto a serving plate. Pour frosting over top. Serve warm, hot, or room temperature. (Note: If desired, 2 more eggs, butter, and zest can be whisked into batter before baking.)
